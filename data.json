It is a giant, modernist building where Yugoslav politicians once studied socialist theory. After 2003 the school is neglected and decrepit.\nYugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito was born in Kumrovec. This Political School in the same town, was founded by and named after him. The school was built in 1975 as the central educational institution for the staff of the Communist Union of Yugoslavia. Tito himself never got to see the finished building as it wasn\u2019t completed and officially opened until 1981, the year following his death. The school has 145 rooms, including function rooms, gyms, a cinema, a library, a restaurant and a bar. The modernist building is appreciated by many architects and lovers of brutalism\nIt was used for political education until 1990, when the Communism collapsed. The last president of the Political School was Ivica Ra\u010dan, who in 2000 became Croatian prime minister. After 1990, the school was first taken over by the Ministry of the Interior and then by the Ministry of Defence for the training of members of the Croatian Army. From 1990 until 2003 it was home to refugees of the Balkan wars.\n\nDuring my visit in 2018, \u2018Politi\u010dka \u0160kola Josip Broz Tito\u2019 was in a very bad condition with most parts of the copper roof either removed or stolen. The building was sold in 2019.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

Behind its austere fa\u00e7ade there is a wealth of interior styles.\nThe facade of the theater is built in Neo-classical style. Inside I found an interior where Art Nouveau and Art Deco elements are merged together. For example the foyer downstairs has Art Nouveau paneling with mirrors and figurative ceramic tiles from Helman. There is also a caf\u00e9, a smoking room and a winter garden. Construction started in 1905 and was completed at the end of 1906. Owner L\u00e9on Bejay-Dejonghe had bought a city block and found space in the middle for a concert hall. \n\nThe monumental stairwell with oval skylight leads to the two large rooms located on the first floor. Firstly the spectacular Neo-Moorish style theater. Secondly, the smaller polygonal ballroom in the more common Louis XV style.\nEventually it became the center of Brussels nightlife. It became known as \u2018Egidium\u2019, named after the patron saint of the city Gillis. In 1913, he had the Moorish room decorated as a cinema and thereupon changed the name to \u2018Diamant Palace\u2019. After the death of the first owner Bejay-Dejonghe, Fernand Dierckx bought the building and turned it into a dance venue under the name \u2018Panth\u00e9on Palace\u2019.\nPriest G. Simons bought the building in 1929 and had it renovated by architect L\u00e9on Denis. Works included both a new dining room and projection booth. It became a meeting place for the local people, where all kinds of religious and social activities took place. In fact he named the theater \u2018Aegidium\u2019 again. Again the building was both renovated and was given a new purpose in 1933, when it became a movie theater. For this, the conference room was divided in two by a concrete ceiling in 1956. In 1979 the building underwent another transformation into a community centre. However the building was abandoned only several years later in 1985. I visited the theater in 2020, just before the last reconversion took place.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

A four-story prison wing is attached to the courthouse. The prison had space for 55 prisoners, including nine women.\nThe courthouse and prison were designed in 1898 by construction officer Paul Thoemer for the Prussian Ministry of Public Works. The old buildings in the old town of K\u00f6penick had simply become too small. The key was ceremoniously handed over on the first of December in 1901. The cells are small and there is no furniture, only a wooden folding bed. The toilet was a bucket. The corridors between the cells are secured by steel balustrades, the stairs are barred. The architects obviously guided practicality and a good overview for the guards during the design.\nIn May 1933 the SA took over the prison. The SA or Sturmabteilung, was a paramilitary organization whose methods of violent intimidation played a key role in Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power. The prison had a part in the \u2018K\u00f6penick Week of Blood\u2019. This was a week of arrests, torture and killings by the SA in June 1933. Approximately 500 opponents of National Socialism, identified as political non-conformists and Jews were detained. At least 23 died.\nAfter the Second World War, the DDR initially used the building as a men\u2019s and youth prison and later as a detention center. In 1964 the television of the DDR took over the cell building and housed a costume collection with tailoring. The building has been largely empty since the 1980s. I visited the \u2018Preu\u00dfisches Amtsgerichtsgef\u00e4ngnis\u2019 in 2019.\nIt has been a listed building since 1977. In 1980 a memorial for the victims of the K\u00f6penick Blood Week was built in the cellar. It was significantly extended in September 1987 and named \u2018Memorial of K\u00f6penick Week of Blood June 1933\u2019. A new permanent exhibition was opened here in 2013 to mark the 80th anniversary of the K\u00f6penick Week of Blood. The exhibition pinpoints the events in the context of the Nazi national consolidation of power in 1933 and shows very clearly the extent to which these actions in June were a \u201ctest case\u201d for the Nazi leadership. In other words, it became clear to the Nazis that they could torture and murder their opponents without any resistance from police, the courts and society in general.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

Very fine watermark paper were produced the first years, in particular official papers for the government. The paper mill was privatized in 1886.\nFrom 1886, a new paper machine was installed that could make paper with a width of 180 centimeter. In fact for this new machine, a new production hall was built. During this time, three bleach plants, a cellulose storage and two warehouses were built. In 1905 the company \u2018Felix Schoeller & Bausch\u2019 from Neu Kali\u00df in Mecklenburg bought the Hohenofen factory.\nFrom 1953 different papers, such as transparent drawing paper, transparent blueprint paper, book paper, cardboard, manila crepe, knurled paper and wrapping paper were produced. The annual production that year was 820 tons paper. During 1967 production was switched to the exclusive production of transparent drawing paper. The paper was exported to the entire Eastern Bloc, right up to Cuba.\nShortly after the fall of the iron curtain, production was stopped due to the competition from the west. Eventually the plant had to close in 1992 and almost 140 employees lost their job. However in 2003 the buildings and machines became an industrial monument and were saved from demolition.\nNowadays, the main building not only functions as a museum, but also as a location for concerts and other cultural events.

The huge mine site was abandoned in 2008.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Prussian state needed large quantities of coal for the nationalized railroad and also for the imperial navy. From 1903 the state-owned company Bergwerks-AG Recklinghausen was founded. One of the mines that were built was the Westerholt colliery.\nThe mine went into operation in 1910 and was equipped with two headframes. Shaft 1 was ready in 2008, shaft 2 in 2010. In 1912 a coking plant was put into operation. In 1927 the Westerholt colliery became the property of Hibernia AG. The coking plant was expanded in 1929, it was used for the coking of the Westerholt and Bergmannsgl\u00fcck coal.\nWesterholt suffered serious damage during the Second World War. The headframe above shaft 2 was the only one in the Ruhr area that was destroyed in a bomb attack. In the 1950s, the colliery was given a new central production shaft. Also after the Second World War, the Polsum mine was connected to the Westerholt mine. This shaft went into operation in 1949. In 1956 the construction of a new production shaft \u2018Westerholt 3\u2019 began on the old coke plant site. The coke plant moved to Hassel, further west in 1953.\nIn 1998 the Westerholt mine was taken over by \u2018DSK\u2019 or \u2018Deutsche Steinkohle AG\u2019. Westerholt merged with the F\u00fcrst Leopold mine in Dorsten to form \u2018Bergwerk Lippe\u2019. Also the shafts in Polsum and Altendorf became part of the Lippe mine. Shaft 1 was rebuilt and received a new tower conveyor system in 2001. This made it easier and faster to move large pieces of equipment underground. Despite these investments, the mine was closed earlier than planned. The existing coal stocks could have provided coal until 2020.\nThe Westerholt 2 shaft was abandoned and backfilled in 1999, the headframe was demolished. On December 19, 2008, the other shafts and therefore \u2018Zeche Westerholt\u2019 was shut down when the last wagon of coal was brought into the daylight. Numerous buildings have been preserved from the time of its founding, which together with more recent buildings reflect almost a century of mining architecture.

The site was codenamed \u20185H32-West\u2019 by the Soviets.\nDuga was a Soviet over-the-horizon, or OTH radar system used as part of the Soviet ABM early-warning network. The system operated from July 1976 to December 1989.\n\nThe Duga-1 consisted of two sites, Chernobyl-2 and Liubech-1, not far from the town of Chernihiv. The two transmitting antennas were located in Liubech and the two receiving antennas, here in Chernobyl-2. \n\nBecause of different ways of counting the installations and the secrecy that surrounded them the radar is quite frequently, but incorrectly referred to as Duga-3, when in fact Duga-3 was never constructed.\nThe Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10 MW in some cases. It broadcasted in the shortwave radio bands. They appeared without warning, sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10 Hz, which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the \u2018Russian Woodpecker\u2019. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcast, amateur radio, commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including \u2018Woodpecker Blankers\u2019 in their design.\n\nThe unclaimed signal was a source for much speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet mind control and weather control experiments.

The hospital consisted of several departments and buildings.\nFor over 80 years the hospital was separated by a wall from the rest of the city. The site is situated in the so-called Z\u0142otoryja Forest on the outskirts of Legnica. Most of the buildings are connected by underground passages. The main building has an impressive facade that is 235 meters long. The hospital rooms were divided over three floors with balconies, so the patients could enjoy the fresh air and the view of the garden.\n\nThe facility was only to accommodate army personnel or state officials and was an \u2018evacuation hospital\u2019. This meant only two thirds of its 650 bed capacity was used. One third had to be left empty at all times in case of war.\n\nThe complex consisted of 24 buildings. It included administrative buildings, warehouses, fuel depots, an autopsy room, laboratories, boiler rooms, canteens, clubs, a full-size swimming pool, a cinema, a club with a stage and even a chapel which has survived in excellent condition. You can see the active hospital in this old movie.\n\nThe Soviet Army took over the hospital at the end of the Second World War and made no alterations. They used it until 1993. After the Soviets left Poland, the hospital was bought by a group of private investors. They kept the buildings sealed but did not manage to sell the old hospital site. In 2019 the owners stopped paying the security and the buildings were looted and trashed in a very short time.

The city\u2019s thermal waters are used to treat about 70 diseases. Baths were arranged directly at the spring, therefore no hotel in Tskaltubo had its own therapy baths.\n\nThe hotel was designed by Dr. V.K. Oltarzhevski and B.A. Sobolevski as an example of late Stalinist architecture. The building had a capacity of 732 beds. Major reconstruction works took place in 1963-65, when the back fa\u00e7ade was attached. Starting in 1984, three years of necessary repairs started.\nTskaltubo was one of the most popular resorts in the former Soviet Union. So when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the town of Tskaltubo was mostly abandoned. Meanwhile the hotels and sanatoria were left empty to crumble and decay.\nToday this hotel is one of Tskaltubo\u2019s disused buildings that houses refugees of the nearby Abkhazia region. The War in Abkhazia from 1992 to 1993 was fought between Georgian forces and Abkhaz separatists, the Russian armed forces and North Caucasian militants. Thereupon about 9 thousand refugees were housed in Tskaltubo. It was supposed to be a temporary arrangement, but 25 years later, these makeshift apartments have become permanent homes for new generations of families. Today, the condition of the Hotel Tbilisi building is extremely bad.

The city was designated as a balneotherapy centre and spa resort by the Soviet government and it was one of Stalin\u2019s favourite vacation spots. \nSince the 18th century several foreign researchers gave word of the healing properties of the Tskaltubo springs. Meanwhile in 1920 the territory of Tskaltubo became state property and it acquired the function of balneology resort. Balneotherapy is the treatment of disease and medical conditions by bathing in mineral-enriched water.\nIn 1953, Tskaltubo became an important spa-resort during the Soviet times. Eventually there were 19 sanatoriums and pensions, nine baths, a resort park and the Scientific Institute of Balneology and Physiotherapy. Tskaltubo mineral water cures both diseases from the limbs, peripheral nervous system and skin. It also cures cardiac and vascular diseases. The water emerges at a comfortable temperature for bathing, in fact it is directly transferred from the springs to the baths, without cooling or heating.\nThe town must have been really impressive in its golden days. The architecture is a mix of classical Stalinist architecture and the Georgian ethnic decor with Gothic and Roman features. The bathhouse has not only inner yards but also private baths hidden in the basement.\n\nDespite the popularity, Georgia\u2019s independence in 1991 and the fall of the Soviet Union later that year, were the start of the end. In fact it was the main reason of the collapse of Tskaltubo\u2019s spa industry. Without guests, most of the hotels and resorts were forced to close their doors. Sadly now it\u2019s in a rather poor condition. It is basically a ruin, most of the interior is gone. I visited \u2018Tskaltubo Bathhouse No. 5\u2019 in 2019.

In 1888 the two shooting ranges, Kummersdorf and J\u00fcterbog were linked by a rail line. The whole area really gained in strategic significance with the construction of this railway. Because of the, by 1910 there were quite a few army barracks in W\u00fcnsdorf-Zossen. A telephone and telegraph office was established in 1912 and the infantry school followed the year after that. The 60.000-acre area had become Europe\u2019s largest military base by the time the First World War started in 1914.\nW\u00fcnsdorf remained important from a military perspective even after the war, with barracks, a military hospital and stables. These buildings were part of the \u2018Milit\u00e4rturnanstalt\u2019 or \u2018Heeressportschule\u2019 that was established in 1919. The German team trained here ahead of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.\nIn 1945 the buildings became \u2018Das Haus der Offiziere\u2019 (Officers\u2019 House) under Soviet administration. The Cold War started and in this building the Russians prepared themselves for the Third World War. The Officers\u2019 House were most certainly the most luxury part of W\u00fcnsdorf with leisure facilities such as a theatre and swimming pool. W\u00fcnsdorf was a closed town during the time it was occupied by the Soviet forces, and effectively became a Soviet town in the heart of Germany. A daily delivery via a direct rail link from Moscow allowed the town to isolate itself from the surrounding areas.\nIn the 1950s the site was modernized. Firstly the pool was rebuilt. Secondly the gymnasium was turned into a theater and there were many more buildings added. Shops, barber shops, schools, a museum, a special radio and television studios, the town had it all. A giant statue of Lenin was built in front of the central building looking over the old soccer field.\nThe site was abandoned in 1994. When the Soviet army left in 1994 the population dropped from 60,000 to just 6,000 people. I visited the location in 2016.

As a result the number of beds doubled to about 420 in the early 1930s. Architect Arnold Beschoren was responsible for the complex expansion and renovation. Thanks to the discovery of antibiotics, tuberculosis was cured faster.

In other words, a cultural complex with a library, for example a gym, a music school and an auditorium.\nIn short, the Cultural Palace was the place to be for social gatherings. Before the Second World War, this Russian mining settlement Pyramiden was a sleepy place, with hardly any residents at all. First mining on the island took place in 1910 by a Swedish company. However, in 1927 the Swedes sold Pyramiden to the Russian mining company Russkij Grumant.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Soviets invested more money in the town. After that they constructed dozens of new buildings, including this recreation center called the Cultural Palace. All buildings were constructed in the typical Soviet block-style fashion, in contrast they had rounded edges to lessen the impact of the bitter winter wind.\nSoviets considered a contract in Pyramiden to be something of a promotion and privilege. So in Pyramiden quality of life mattered. The Cultural Palace featured a library, several rooms for sports and a large auditorium with rows of cushy red seats. This was the place where performances took place and movies were shown. Altogether it was a meeting point for all residents.\nAbout 90 percent of the population were active in some kind of cultural or sports activity. Therefore cultural and sports interests were registered, along with the work experience, the day after arrival at Pyramiden. As a result they could custom fit the spare time, to make it a good place to be. That way everyone would contribute to the community.\nPyramiden was abandoned in 1998. The residents never returned, and today the town still stands much as it was when the last men departed. At the top of the main street, a statue of Lenin watches over the abandoned town and the beautiful Nordenki\u00f6ld glacier.

At first, Pyramiden was a sleepy place, with hardly any residents at all. But after the Second World War, the Soviets invested more money to the town.\nPyramiden had over a thousand inhabitants in its heyday. Its agriculture was organized along the lines of Soviet collective farming, and included a vegetable greenhouse and this animal farm housing dairy cattle, pigs, hens and a single horse. Consequently hey focused on own production of milk, meat, eggs and vegetables. Of course fish was also on the menu. The farm and slaughterhouse were built in 1972. Later in 1985, the large greenhouse was built. In fact for some time, the production surplus was such that eggs could be exported to Longyearbyen.\n\nOther food supplies were shipped to Pyramiden and made it a settlement in abundance. In fact all food was free of charge from 1958. In the 1980s the share of women and children grew, more than 1,000 people lived in Pyramiden.

		"description": "This is an abandoned Russian mine on the island of Svalbard. In 1998 the mine was closed and the village of Pyramiden abandoned.\nAccording to old archives Svalbard was discovered in 1194, but it remained unknown until it was rediscovered by the Dutch explorers Willem Barentsz and Jacob van Heemskerck in June 1596. Dutch and English whalers arrived as early as 1611. The Russians arrived about 1715.\nNot only whales, but also the presence of coal made the islands interesting. Many countries claimed their rights. The claims were settled by a treaty granting possession to Norway and mineral rights on an equal basis to various countries.\n\nThe first coal was brought from Svalbard to the mainland Norway, with the purpose of selling it there in 1899. Before, coal from Spitsbergen had occasionally been used locally on a very small scale.\nThis old mining town Pyramiden is situated in Billefjorden, its name is derived from the pyramid shaped mountain close by. Exploration of the coal deposits here started in the summer of 1910 with a Swedish expedition. The experimental operation showed to be promising. As a result the area was annexed by the Swedes and a few mines were opened. But the conditions in Pyramiden proved to be difficult. Therefore the Swedes sold Pyramiden to the Russian mining company Russkij Grumant in 1927. In the beginning of the 1930s it was sold again, then to the Russian state-owned Trust Arktikugol. This company started prior to the Second World War, but the scale of operation was small. After the war things took a turn.\n\nWork in the mines of Pyramiden was very popular through the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The workers had a contract period of two years and the wages were decent. As a result they could choose amongst the best workers. Pyramiden was considered a good place to be.\nIn total, Pyramiden produced approximately 9 million tons of coal between 1955 and 1998. One million tons of this was consumed locally in the power plant; the rest was shipped out of Svalbard. The coal seams in Pyramiden are several metres thick, but were complicated to extract. Therefore the coal mining was discontinued in 1998. The mine and town were abandoned, the residents never returned. Today the town still stands much as it was when the last family departed.\n\nToday, Russian activities are concentrated on Barentsburg near the entrance of the Isfjord, and soon possibly a new mine will be opened in the Colesdalen.

The first known owners was Ivana Korvina, son of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. He owned the castle from 1490 until 1504. After Korvina died, the property was owned by Juraj Brandenburg until 1524. Brandenburg sold the building to Ratkaj family. In 1772, Ivan Rattkay left the Mali Tabor castle to his nephew, the baron Joseph Wintershoffen, in whose possession it remained until 1818. Later the castle was inherited by Rikard Jela\u010di\u0107 from Zapre\u0161i\u0107. He owned the castle until 1876, and from then it was owned by the Irish baron Henry Cavanagh, whose descendants kept the castle until the end of the Second World War.\n\nIn the earliest phase of construction the castle had the shape of a rectangular building with defense walls and four semi-towers. The western wall, is probably the original defense wall of the old Mali Tabor castle.\nDuring the second phase of construction the castle was transformed into a one-storied Baroque palace. It remained in this function until the 19th century. In 1861 a one-storied annex was built in the eastern wing of the castle on the northern side. This was also the time when the northern defense wall of the castle was torn down and a new entrance portal was built. The portal has been preserved to this day. The castle is abandoned for many years today. It is in a bad state and for sale. These photos of \u2018Mali Tabor\u2019 were taken in 2018.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

It was owned by the SAMGA, short for \u2018Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Magasins \u00e0 Grains d\u2019Anvers\u2019. This company was founded in 1892.\n\nFrom 1870 the Agricultural Invasion started. As a result cheap grain arrived in Antwerp by ship from America, Canada and Russia. The grain was manually removed in the port. Grain traders wanted to make it easier, more efficient and, above all, cheaper. So they made plans to built silos and automate the transport.\nThe original building had four towers on top of the roof, two on either side. Grain was transported up on both sides of the building, that makes this silo a unique building. After a V1 bomb damaged the building during the Second World War, the building was repaired and upgraded. Firstly two levels were added on top of the building and the towers where shortened. Secondly a new transport system was installed on the top floors. The system was replaced in 1977.\n\nIn 1939 a second SAMGA silo was built beside this one. Furthermore, a third silo was built in front of silo A in 1971.

It produces flagstones and ceramic floor tiles. The buildings where built by contractor Jottier. The site was called \u2018Koterij van Meuntje Rot\u2019 by locals.\nThe former tile factory consists of two halls under saddle roofs. At the back is a third hall. At the back was a furniture factory that specialized in cinema seats. Two tile sizes were made: 20cm square and 16cm square. The motifs were inspired by tile motifs of large ceramic enterprises. It was Emmanuel Rottiers himself who designed the motives.\nThe interior of the factory gives a good picture of the production in 1930: machinery, equipment, molds, finished tiles were preserved in the buildings. In the engine room there is a heavy diesel generator. Via horizontal shafts attached to the ceiling, the drive was transferred with straps and wooden pulleys to the other devices. There were also electric generators for supplying power. I also found a milling machine, metal lathe, drill stand, and a hydraulic system with three pistons.\nThe production of tiles had initially rapid expansion, but already in 1939 the factory had to close its doors. In the 1990s plans were made to demolish the halls, just like the concrete factory that stood across the street, but the factory with the entire contents was protected in 1998. Despite the protection the complex in recent years fallen into oblivion. Both the house and the factory are in a very bad condition. In May 2017, a year after my visit, restoration works started.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

The castle is located in Fontenay-Tr\u00e9signy alongside the Br\u00e9on stream, in the heart of a once walled old town.\nThe history of the town is closely linked to the history of the ch\u00e2teau. The castellans were lords of Fontenay-en-Brie during the Old Regime. The architecture of the ch\u00e2teau is marked by the different eras when it was rebuilt after falling more or less in ruins.\n\nThe medieval castle was rebuilt by Jean Le Mercier in 1389. It was enclosed by walls and moat, situated around a courtyard with two drawbridges. It used to be built on a pilgrimage road from Paris to Rome. The lord of the castle collected toll from travellers passing through his domain. The current building has retained the rectangular plan, flanked by round towers. Guillaume Prudhomme rebuild the castle after 1538.\nThe present ch\u00e2teau dates from the first half of the 17th century. It was built by Jean de Nogaret de La Valette, and was planned as a pleasure palace. The rooms were made comfortable and decorated with tapestries and paintings. The ground floor and the guard room floor were covered with large glazed tiles. The ch\u00e2teau did not undergo major changes until the beginning of the 19th century. The Marquis de Gontaut-Biron, the owner in 1837, restored the main house, the side wing and the two other wings. To open up the courtyard he pulled down the entrance wing with its turrets, the drawbridge, and two of the corner towers that housed the gothic chapel and a prison. The gardens and the old farm were landscaped into a leisure park.\nThe ch\u00e2teau has been classified as a Monument since 1963 and its park land is included in the List of Remarkable Gardens of France. In the 1940s, the ch\u00e2teau of Fontenay was occupied by youth camps. In 2006, Mr. Samuel Tasse sold the ch\u00e2teau to a property developer specializing in historic buildings, which came forward with plans for dividing it into twelve apartments and creating another forty-eight in the various outbuildings. However, this was not brought to completion, due to the developer going into liquidation in 2014. The ch\u00e2teau continues to decay.

Subsequently already in 1849, the first works begin.\n\nFort 44 Tonie is an armored fort of the Krak\u00f3w Fortress. It was built in 1878 as so-called provisional work, in the form of an earth-and-wooden rampart. In the years 1883-1885 it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort. It belonged to the IV defense sector who defended the Olkusz route.\nIn the years 1902-1909, the fort underwent a modernization. Initially the artillery rampart was transformed for use by the infantry. Secondly, the main shelter received structural reinforcements. As a result the total thickness of ceilings and exposed walls are 2.5 meter, making it resistant to hits of 28 cm grenades. However, modernization was very expensive, the total total cost of construction and modernization amounted to 2.936.406 crowns. It was a sum about two-and-a-half times higher than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1980s and as many as seven times the cost of a small armored defense fort from the 1990s.\nIn 1914 the fort, despite some shortages of weapons, was the most modern and strongest in the fortress. It undoubtedly had the highest resistance to hostile fire. The full-time staff after modernization was 428 soldiers, including 11 officers. The armament included sixteen cannons. Secondly two cannons for the defense of the neck moat and eight portable machine guns. But Tonie did not participate in the battles during the First World War.\nIn the interwar period, Tonie serve the Polish Army as barracks. During the German occupation, it served as a warehouse for captured small arms. After the Second World War it was used by the army for many years. For this reason it housed warehouses with ammunition and explosives. The army left it at the beginning of the 1990s and until 2008 the fort remained unused, although it was guarded 24/7. In the spring of 2008 the fort was taken over by the \u2018Janus Foundation for Active Protection of Monuments of Technology and Cultural Heritage\u2019.

For instance it had a capacity of 1800-2000 tons pig iron a day. In 1970 \u2018Esp\u00e9rance-Longdoz\u2019 and its facilities, including HF6, were taken over by the other Li\u00e8ge-based steel enterprise \u2018Cockerill-Ougr\u00e9e-Providence\u2019. Coupled with this group, it became the fifth largest steelmaker in the European Economic Community.\nEventually the Cockerill group merged in 1981 with the Charleroi-based Hainaut-Sambre, giving birth to Cockerill-Sambre. In Li\u00e8ge only blast furnaces HF6 and HFB were left in activity. During the ownership of Cockerill-Sambre, HF6 was largely renovated and refurbished. Further improvements occurred after the company\u2019s transformation into Arcelor in 1999.

		"description": "Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin was one of the airports in Berlin. Situated in the south-central Berlin borough of Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg, the airport ceased operating in 2008.\nTempelhof was designated as an airport by the Ministry of Transport on 8 October 1923. However the old terminal was originally constructed in 1927. In anticipation of increasing air traffic, the Nazi government began a massive reconstruction in the mid-1930s.\n\nThe airfield had two parallel runways. Firstly runway 09L/27R, 2.094 meters long. Secondly runway 09R/27L witch was 1.840 meter long. Both runways were paved with tarmac. The taxiway was in the shape of an oval around these two runways, with a single terminal on the northwest side of the airport.\nOne of the airport\u2019s most distinctive features is its massive, canopy-style roof extending over the tarmac. As a result it was able to accommodate most contemporary airliners in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, protecting passengers from the elements. Tempelhof Airport\u2019s main building was once among the top 20 largest buildings on earth. In contrast, it had the world\u2019s smallest duty-free shop. Throughout the Cold War years, Tempelhof was the main terminal for American military transport aircrafts accessing West Berlin. However with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the presence of American forces in Berlin ended. As a result the USAF 7350th Air Base Group at Tempelhof was deactivated in June 1993.\nZentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin closed all operations on 30 October 2008, despite the efforts of some protesters to prevent the closure. The former airfield has subsequently been used as a recreational space known as \u2018Tempelhofer Feld\u2019 and as an emergency refugee camp. I visited the airport in 2016, just after the refugee camp was closed. More transport themed abandoned locations can be seen here.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

Because the small local electricity producers could not keep up with demand, the PNEM had its first power plant built in Geertruidenberg between 1915 and 1919. The buildings were designed by architect G.J. van Swaaij.\n\nThe first plant had a capacity of 18.5 megawatts. But because of the high demand for electricity there were new plants built in 1920 and 1931. At the end of the Second World War the buildings were bombed by the German army. Because of this it took three years to get the site running again.\nIn 1952 a new power plant was built two kilometers to the North, along the river Amer. In the 1970s this \u2018Amercentrale\u2018 became so powerful that the Dongecentrale lost its purpose. So in 1972 the Dongecentrale was closed and in 1976 it was transformed to a STEG plant with a capacity of 121 megawatts. STEG stands for STEam and Gas. So coal was no longer needed and because a STEG can be started up very quickly \u2013 a matter of eight hours \u2013 the plant was only used to help with peak power requirements.\n\nThe original power plant, dated from 1919 was demolished in the 1990s.

This is a semi-synthetic fiber which resembles silk, but typically costs less to produce and was made out of viscose. Until 1913, the production of artificial silk grows heavily, the factory is increasing from 8.000 to 21.000 m\u00b2 in ten years. The plant employed 790 workers in 1913.\n\nIn 1914, at the start of First World War, the city is occupied and the factory is transformed partly into a hospital. The other part was transformed into a fat, margarine and canned foods factory. In the meantime the industrial textile machines were shipped to Germany.\nEventually, after the war, production in the Givet factory continued. In 1920, the artificial silk production exceeded the production of natural silk. Beginning in 1950, the appearance of synthetic fibers, nylon and terylene, and their success on the market, led to the decline of artificial silk. As a result, in the 1990s the first artificial silk factories closed down. Consequently Cellatex had gone into liquidation during the year 2000. Because of those circumstances the workers threatened to blow up the factory, and empty acid into the nearby river. Even though that would resulted in a widespread pollution and decimate wildlife. Eventually, the authorities gave in and the workers got their severance pay.\n\nThe factory had only 153 employees at the date of its liquidation in July 2000. It also lost its last patents. It was the last viscose company, working from paper pulp, from eighteen factories in France exploiting this industrial sector twenty years earlier.

In 2020 a luxury hotel was opened in the old castle.\nThe very first mention of the village Tura is dated 1220. At that time the \u00c1kos family owned the town. In 1425 one of the family\u2019s descendants, Mikl\u00f3s \u00d6rd\u00f6g Prodavizi, gave the estate to King Sigismund in exchange for other properties.\nUntil 1873 Tura was owned by the Esterh\u00e1zy family. But in 1873 local businessman and baron Sigmund Schossberger bought the property. He built the castle we know today. The castle was ready 1883 and used as a summer residence. The building lies in the middle of a 10-hectare park. For a long time, there was a belief that Mikl\u00f3s Ybl was the architect, but in one of the publications of a local newspaper published in 1885, Gyula Bukovics was mentioned as the architect. The architect from Prague moved in 1868 to Budapest, where he joined Mikl\u00f3s Ybl and soon became the head of his design office.\nIn 1906, the important musical composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k lived here. During the Second World War German officers used the castle for housing. It was used as a war hospital in 1945. In 1946, it became a primary school. It was named a national monument in 1958.\nThe castle was a primary school until 1973, after which it was abandoned. It became owned by a public company and has been sold and bought several times since the 1980\u2019s.\nThe castle was rented for filming the 2008 movie \u2018The Secret of Moonacre\u2019. The new owner, Hungarian entrepreneur Tiborcz Istv\u00e1n transformed Schossberger into a five star hotel. They added a second wing, and a conference room, a luxury restaurant and over 100 rooms.

In 1911 the plant was in operation with a capacity of 3.200 KW. But in 1914, four turbo generators and 16 boilers were installed with a capacity of 14.1 MW.

The plant was named \u2018Kraftwerk Friedensgrenze\u2019 during those years.\nThe power plant was closed after more than 80 years, in 1992. The plant employed about 5.000 people in those years and produced 71.3 million Mwh energy. It was shut down for economic reasons. In the same year, machine room II with its technical installations and the administration building were placed under monument protection. Later these parts of Kraftwerk Hirschfelde housed an very nice museum. But in 2017 also the museum had to close its doors.

It was built in 1938 as \u2018Fliegerhorst Briesen\u2018 a military airport for the Luftwaffe, part of the German Wehrmacht.\nThe airfield was built by the Luftwaffe during the expansion of the army by Nazi Germany, between 1938 and 1939. Originally there was a grass runway with a length of one kilometer. Also several barracks and a train station were built. In fact there were no active planes stationed at the site, but it was used as a training school for pilots. In January 1951, work began on expanding the former Luftwaffe airbase for the Soviet armed forces. \nThe Soviet forces extended the small airfield by a 2,5 kilometer long concrete main runway. In 1958 they built another, 2 kilometer long runway. At the end of the main runway there is an aircraft parking area with shelters and ammunition bunkers. Also they built hardened aircraft shelter for the planes in the years 1970 until 1983. The Russian radio call sign for the airfield was ZWEROBOJ or \u0417\u0412\u0415\u0420\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0419.\nIn 1992 the Red Army left Germany, as a result the site was back in German control. Eventually in 1996 it was sold to Cargolifter, a German company founded in 1996. Cargolifter offered logistical services through point-to point transport of heavy and outsized loads. This service was in general based on the development of a heavy lift airship, the CL160, a vessel designed to carry a 160-tons payload. The hangar for production and operation of the CL160 and engineering team facilities was built in 1998. The hangar is 360 meter long, 220 meter wide and 106 meter high. It\u2019s a technological marvel in itself, the freestanding steel-dome \u201cbarrel-bowl\u201d construction is large enough to fit the Eiffel Tower on its side.

The circuit became known to be among the fastest of the era. Particularly because of its two long straight roads, each 2.2 km in length. They allowed maximum straight-line speed, resulting in many famous slipstream battles.\n\nTo create loopholes and allow the circuit to be even faster, trees were cut down along roadsides. Also some old houses were demolished. In 1926, during the Grand Prix de la Marne, driver Fran\u00e7ois Lescot won in his Bugatti T35B 2L C.

It is situated 15 km northwest of the city of Chernobyl and 16 km from the Belarus border.\nReactor 4 was the power station where the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 occurred. The disaster was the worst nuclear power plant accident in history.\n\nThe event occurred during a late-night safety test which simulated a plant blackout. In fact safety systems were intentionally turned off for this test. A combination of bad reactor design and operators working contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions. Water became steam, generating a destructive explosion and fire.\n36 hours after the accident, Soviet officials finally enacted a 10-kilometer exclusion zone. That resulted in the rapid evacuation of 49 thousand people primarily from Pripyat. Meanwhile ash plumes and subsequent fallout filled the sky. As a result the evacuation zone was increased from 10 to 30 km about one week after the accident. Approximately 100,000 km\u00b2 of land was significantly contaminated with fallout. The worst hit regions were Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. In the meantime slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe.\n\nThe battle to contain the contamination and prevent a bigger catastrophe, involved over 500 thousand workers. The costs were estimated on 18 billion rubles. During the accident itself 31 people died. The long-term effects such as cancers are still being investigated.\nThe completion of the first reactor in 1977 was followed by Reactor 2 in 1978. Reactor 3 was built in 1981 and 4 in 1983. Two more reactors, 5 and 6, capable of producing 1,000 MW each, were under construction at the time of the accident. Reactor 5 was about 70% complete at the time of the accident. It was scheduled to start operating in November 7, 1986. However, the works were halted on January 1, 1988. The tower cranes and other machinery were left behind. Furthermore, a 6th reactor was planned in a new block of buildings scheduled to be completed in 1994.\nFollowing the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. The Ukrainian government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country. However in October 1991, a fire broke out in the turbine building of Reactor 2. The authorities declared the reactor damaged beyond repair, and consequently it was taken offline. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 and on 15 December 2000 President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off Reactor 3 in an official ceremony.\n\nThe Chernobyl Power Plant site should be clean by 2065.

It housed both employees of the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and the builders of the city. Eventually Pripyat was officially declared a city in 1979. The town had a population of 49 thousand people in 1985.\nThe average age in Pripyat was about 26 years old. It had 15 kindergartens and elementary schools for 4.980 children, and 5 secondary schools for 6.786 students. There were 25 stores and malls, many cafes, cafeterias, and restaurants that collectively could serve up to 5.535 customers. Also Pripyat had 10 warehouses that could hold 4.430 tons of goods.\nThe Chernobyl disaster happened in the night of 26 April 1986. In reality Pripyat was not immediately evacuated. Instead the people went about their usual business in the early hours of the morning, completely unknown of what had just happened. However, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. Later they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting. Because the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident.\n\nOn 27 April at 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, the first buses had arrived in Pripyat to start the evacuation. To speed up the evacuation, residents were told to bring only what was necessary, and that they would remain evacuated for not more than three days. As a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and remain there today.\nFrom 1986 until 1988 the city of Slavutych was constructed to replace Pripyat. In fact it was built intentionally for the evacuated personnel of the Power Plant. Today, this is the second-largest city for accommodating power plant workers and scientists in the Russian Commonwealth.\nAlthough Pripyat is located within the administrative district of Ivankivs\u2019kyi district, the abandoned city is part of the larger Kiev province and is administered directly from Kiev.

Due to the increasing electricity demand the capacity of the power plant was increased and two new power generation units were installed in 1914 and two new steam boilers in 1917. After the end of the Second World War, when \u2018Kelenf\u00f6ld Power Plant\u2018 was not capable to operate, the \u2018\u00dajpest Power Plant\u2019 had to supply also some more distant areas. From 1953, the low caloric value of coal was compensated by the use of heavy oil.\nAs a result of the increase in the steam demand of the industrial plants at \u00dajpest and of the heat demand of the housing estates, heat supply started also from \u00dajpest Plant. The power plant started to supply hot water for the district heating system in 1978.\nAt present, the power plant has an installed electrical capacity of 111 MWe, an installed hot water capacity of 342 MWth and a steam delivery capacity of 40 t/h. These photos were taken in the oldest part of the power plant. In the early days there were several steam engines here. Today there is only one engine left on standby for when the demand is high.\nI visited \u2018\u00dajpesti Er\u0151m\u0171\u2019 in 2015.

Because of the growing use of the railway, the national railway company wanted to add a new line for freight trains. For safety the railway is placed on an elevated bank. In fact the earth used to built the bank is taken from the lands south of Hofstade. In 1902 the first earth is dug away. The digging stopped in 1912 when the First World War started. During these years the holes filled with water, consequently creating two lakes. After the war the digging continued and the lakes grew.\nIn the 1920\u2019s the domain spontaneously became a touristic place, but without facilities. More and more people went here in the hot summers to search for both cool water and recreation. However in 1925 the city of Mechelen claimed the lakes, they were needed to provide the city of water. The lakes were fenced off and armed guards protected the place. As a result the local people and the press started a campaign to get the domain back.\nIt took until 1933 before Hofstade Plage, was a public park again. Thereupon the site was opened by King Albert. A private company run the place and opened a small beach and some catering buildings around it. The following years the place got busier day by day. About 35 thousand people enjoyed the beach on a sunny day. There was a roller skating rink, a cycling track for bikes and also a tennis courts. In addition many restaurants and drinking establishments were grouped together in a square and named Vieux March\u00e9.\nA new master plan for the park was fully developed in 1937 by architect Victor Bourgeois. As a result the cafes and dance halls were demolished. The new infrastructure had to be more sport-oriented. The added infrastructure also included a large outdoor swimming pool. The accompanying buildings were designed by the architect Charles Van Nueten. The beach building, already built in 1938, was designed by Maxime Wynants. There were several food and beverage outlets and an elevated promenade. The large boathouse was designed by F\u00e9lix Milan.\nThe open air swimming pool was built on the old beach. The pool was 100 by 50 meter and was 1.60 m deep. This open air pool was the biggest in Europe for several years. Hofstade had 200 changing rooms. During the Second World War the domain got in German hands, they used the field as a military site. In 1944 the Americans take over the domain and it was used as an army truck repair site for several years. In 1978, the large outdoor pool was taken out of use, the buildings were abandoned in 1990.

The factory was built in 1934 and abandoned 60 years later.\nThe wool carbonizing plant is built along the river Vesdre, which connects Dolhain and Verviers. Carbonizing of wool is done to remove the impurities from wool. In this case this is done by treatment with acid producing salts. Carbonized wool are more porous than scoured wool. As a result the dye uptake is higher. Uneven dyeing may result due to faulty carbonizing.\n\nIn 1983 the company merges with its biggest rival, the Verviers based plant \u2018Belgium Solvent\u2019. Later, the new company is renamed \u2018Traitex\u2018, a company still active today. It is the only European firm still active in the sector of washing and carbonizing wool. The Dolhain factory closed in 1994, production is taken over in the Verviers factory. Eventually a plan to rebuild the site for housing started in 2005. Luckily the original facade will be saved.

Today the site is a museum.\nIn the night of 1 to 2 August 1901 professor Andr\u00e9 Dumont discovered the first coal in Limburg. This was the start of the industrialization and growth of the region. As a result seven coal mines were established. The reason for this was the heavy demand for high-quality coal from steel producers in Belgium and abroad.\nCompany \u2018Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme Charbonnages de Beeringen\u2019 was founded in 1907. The digging of the mine shafts also started in 1907, but was interrupted during the First World War. From 1922 the mine shafts were 727, 789 and 850 meter deep and produced 79.332.200 ton coal over the years. In 1948 the colliery employed 6796 miners.\nThe golden age of coal production started right after the Second World War and lasted until the late 1950s, when cheaper energy sources were made available elsewhere. The coal mine in Beringen closed its doors on October 28, 1989. The remaining slag heaps and mining buildings are still very obvious around the city. The last active colliery in the Limburg region closed down not much later in 1992.\nThe Beringen colliery was built relatively late. The fact is that the coal region around Limburg was one of the last to be built and the first to close down in the whole of Europe. For this reason it is still in an impressively good condition. Nowadays parts of the colliery near Beringen houses the Flemish Mining Museum. The cooling towers dated from 1923, 1926, 1942 and 1952 are protected and will be restored. Also the heavily damaged coal washing plant will be restored. Other parts are abandoned and ready to be reconverted to lofts and shops.

Eventually in the 1920s and 1930s it was one of the most modern peak load power plants of the time.\n\nMeanwhile a second 120 meter high chimney was built in 1940. In 1942 the plant is enlarged, a fourth turbine with an output of 20 thousand kilowatt was put into operation. The station had a total output of 54 megawatt.\nAt the end of the Second World War the power plant was closed down. Four weeks later, the Soviets took over and put the plant into use again. It became property of the \u2018Gaskombinat Schwarze Pumpe\u2019. As early as July 22, 1985, the entire complex was placed under monument protection.\nAfter the reunification of Germany in 1991, the plant was handed to the city of Plessa. According to the new usage concept, the energy source should be natural gas, which would have required high investments and major renovations. For this reason the project failed and could not be realized. On April 14, 1992, the last turbine generator was shut down and the power plant was taken off the grid.

This meant the forced moving of 150 families in the villages of Janovas, Lavelilla and Lacort. It would be a huge reservoir to produce electricity.\nExpropriations began in the early 1960s and a few years later, because of the refusal of some of the people to leave, the company began to destroy empty houses without taking any security measures to protect those who still lived in villages. The local school of Janovas was closed by sending away teacher and children by force.\nThe destroyed homes and the closure of the school made it impossible to continue living in Janovas, but the government still ploughed the fields, cut down fruit and olive trees to keep the area uninhabitable. Eventually they cut off the water and electricity and send the army to the prevent people returning. In 1984 the last people were forced out of Janovas.\nIn 2001, after years of social protests, lawsuits and environmental protests a report about the project\u2019s environmental impact was published. The report showed that the plans were against European regulations and the guessed profits were not feasible. The project was officially stopped in 2005.

Xerallo was the best place, there were limestone quarries nearby to supply the raw material. Also it was close to the Malp\u00e0s mines, where they obtained the coal to run the furnaces of the cement factory.\nIn 1947 the machinery for the factory were bought in Belgium and shipped south to Spain. The factory was build in 1948 and 1949, and started production in 1950. In 1952 a conveyor system was built between the mine and the factory, this was much cheaper than the daily transport with trucks.

Due to the improvements made in 1962 at the factory, they reached the milestone of more than 200.000 tons of cement. In April 1973 the Xerallo cement factory closed its doors. The reason was the low profitability. After a few months, all the machinery was dismantled and sold for scrap. The impact of the closure for this region with very little industry, was serious.\n\nIn 1970 the village Xerallo still housed 388 citizens.

In 1928 this was the largest train station in Europe.\nOnly eight years after its opening the line was closed during the Spanish Civil War. In the course of the Second World War, Canfranc became strategically important. Ore, which was needed for the production of arms, was transported to the German Reich via this line. The ore was payed with gold, which was also transported via Canfranc. The Nazi Regime had taken this gold from national banks in European cities and gold from the dead Jewish people, the so-called \u201cplundered gold\u201d.\nThe war ended together with the glory and splendor of the station. Franco closed the railway line for many years. The railway station was used during the filming of Doctor Zhivago in 1965.\nIn 1970 the railway line was closed for good. A fully loaded train moving down the Pyrenees on the French side was derailed and caused the railway bridge of Estanguet to brake down. This accident marked the end of the international railway traffic. Nowadays, trains only move twice a day from Zaragoza to Canfranc and back, on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees. Only a small building is in use. The big station hall is empty and cleaned several years ago. Plans to reconvert the station were never carried out.

Its ideal geographical position made Boulogne a major port for travel and transport to England. It was a major port with two or three million passengers passing through each year.\nIn the 13th century, the first commercial link with England was created in Boulogne. The city Boulogne was massively damaged in the Second World War. After the war the city rebuilt itself into an important port in the 1950s. The ferry terminal was designed by the architects Georges Popesco and Andr\u00e9 Lacoste. It was a modernist vision of the future with sweeping concrete ramps and a unique and complete integration of a car ferry terminal with railway station. Delays in the completion of the car ramp saw the official opening delayed until 16 June 1952.\nIn the end, Boulogne lost many travellers to the Calais ferry-service. The construction of the Channel Tunnel and the development of the port of Calais at the end of the 20th century caused the decline in Boulogne port traffic and the gradual closure of lines. It started with the closing of the Sealink Stena Line car ferry service to Folkstone in 1991. One year later the final ferry service, operated by P&O, closed. Various freight services continued for a few years, together with Hoverspeeds\u2019 SeaCat. But all services stopped not long after the turn of the century.\n\nFor three long years the port was abandoned until Speedferries started a low-cost service in 2004. They moved 710.000 passengers in 2007. As with most of the more recent operators, they proved to be a short-lived. The port was closed again due to unpaid port dues.\n\u2018LD Lines\u2019 are the latest operator to use Boulogne. They operate from the newly built hub port outside the heart of town. As a result, the use of the traditional arrival point for cross-channel passengers has come to an end in 2009. Until just a couple of years ago it was possible to wander around the abandoned railway station with its old railway lines and the adjacent quaysides. Today, fencing prevents even that nostalgic pleasure. Despite its cultural and architectural significance, the site will be demolished in the future.

Not only cargo trains bringing raw materials and taking the processed flour, also a passenger rain passed the site. The old station, just behind the mill is squatted by gypsies. The station operated from 1904 until 1984.\n\nToday the old mill is abandoned and empty. Only one kind of spiral transport ramp that connects two floors is preserved. In reality, the interior of the building has been totally looted and, much of its upper floor, burned down. Also floors are missing and for safety the doors and windows are boarded. The owner, roof-tile factory \u2018Cer\u00e1micas La Oliva\u2019 has no future plans for the building.

The town is situated in the narrow valley of the Torote river. It had 45 houses and also a church and a school. The owners had a cattle farm with large number of cows, horses and sheep. Also there was a big agricultural area where wheat and barley grew.\nThe town housed workers of the Mendoza farm. The workers didn\u2019t owned the houses but could live there as long as they worked on the farm.  \nThe emerging industry during the 1960s became the end of Fresno. As a result young people moved to Madrid where they earned higher salaries and where they could own their own homes. Also the farms were more modern, people were replaced by machines. By 1970 the town is mostly abandoned. Only some farmers stay.\n\nAt the present time the town is owned by a farmer who uses a couple of buildings. Most of the town is rotting away. Houses are in a very bad state and many roofs have collapsed. The parish church had restoration works done in 2001 and 2008. During the works they found a sarcophagus of Juan de Mendoza, descendant of the Marquess of Santillana and second lord of Fresno de Torote. I visited the ghosttown in 2012.

It was a military castle to protect the Kingdom of Toledo. Its strategic position allowed them to control the Tagus river. The Christians captured the castle in 1085, but not for long. In 1113 the King of Sevilla and the King of C\u00f3rdoba and all the other Muslim rulers in the south had gathered a large army of cavalry, infantry and archers. They proceeded to the territory of Toledo and began to attack the castle at Oreja. They massacred the Christians there and took many prisoners. The forces of Alfonso VII, Emperor of Spain took over in 1139. After a siege of 7 months the Muslim garrison surrendered. During the siege the towers of the castle were destroyed.\n\nIn 1171 the castle is rebuilt. The town flourished because of the good economy. It was a town of farmers and merchant with many olive trees, vineyards and grain fields. In 1827 the village housed 45 people living in 10 houses. There was also a parish and later they built a school here.\n\nToday Oreja is a ghost town. On a steep hill in the middle of nowhere you can see the remains of the old castle. Only one tower is left, the other parts are in ruins. The town itself is on the left bank of the Tagus river. It is only one street with two rows of houses and a rather modern chapel.

But the Spanish Civil War made construction of the sanatorium very difficult. The building site is heavily damaged and many construction workers died during these war years.

On the other hand during the French Revolution, several buildings were demolished again. At the end of the 19th century the abbey came into the hands of the \u2018Brothers of the Christian Schools\u2019 who founded a new convent. The brothers expanded their provincial house considerably with a chapel, a novitiate and a rest home. A secretariat was built at the site of the former vegetable garden. The buildings of the monastery were modified several times during the whole of the 20th century.\nToday the domain is reconverted to apartments with a residential care function. The following remainder of the abbey are still visible today: the old infirmary (1631), the Gate building (1730), the priest\u2019s house (1756), the confessional court (1775) and the fence wall (17th century).

It was used to supply electrical energy to railway locomotives and multiple units so that they could operate without having an on-board prime mover. Nowadays there is a bigger and newer power station, this old one closed in 1993.\n\nDue to the economic changes of 1990, the transport volumes were increased. In 1990, many tracks were therefore abandoned and in 1993, half the station was out of service. In December 1996, the station was closed. Today almost all track facilities are removed and the buildings are empty. A part is till in use by the Deutsche Bahn. Today, about 150 people are employed. In addition to gearboxes, other components such as the RK 900 shunting couplings and leaf springs are processed here.\n\nThe big old freight station is now mostly covered in green.

This was an institution for Jewish psychiatric patients and mentally handicapped children. In January 1943, all patients and Jewish staff were deported. Almost nobody returned. \n\nIn 1958 the new center was opened by Queen Juliana with the name \u2018Sinai Kliniek\u2019. In 1968 a children\u2019s wing was added to the hospital building. Besides the health care rooms we also found a gym and swimming pool in this complex. In 1966 the clinic was expanded for day treatment and nursing of mentally handicapped elderly people. The name was changed to \u2018Sinai Centrum\u2019.\n\nIn 2007 the hospital moved to a brand new building in Amstelveen. The old buildings were abandoned and after the vandalizing of the building by local youth the place was locked tight and secured 24/7. In 2010 the buildings were demolished.

The factory was constructed by the company Ing\u00f3lfur hf in 1943. The main reason why the factory was built was because of the growing herring stock coming in to H\u00fanafl\u00f3i bay. But soon after construction, the herring catches declined and the factory was closed in 1952.\n\nThe factory processed the herring to make fish meal and oil. Fish meal is mostly made from fish that are not used for human consumption and is generally used to feed farm animals in agricultural setting. The herring oil was filtered to extract the water and then stored in large heated tanks just outside the factory.

In 1875, barely five years after opening, it was sold to the \u2018Sisters of Charity\u2019 who also took over the old-age and health department of the monastery.\nDuring the year 1894 a new organ was installed at the chapel of Hospital Sint Vincentius by organ builder Joseph Deprez from Gent. A new wing was built on the left side of the building around 1929, later the construction of the parallel south wing and a new building on the west side followed. In the 1980s, the right half of the front building was demolished together with the connecting side and rear wings.

The dungeon and Mesen castle are first named on a map from 1628.\nAfter several owners the building was more often used for industrial purposes. A gin distillery, a sugar factory and other industries housed in the caves of the castle. Later it was sold to a religious order and became a monastery and a boarding school. The boarding school started in 1752 and raised orphans and children of handicapped soldiers. In 1905 the neo-gothic wings are built next to the castle. In one wing they built a beautiful chapel.\nIn 1952, 200 years after the start of the boarding school, the building became a normal school for the people of Lede. Over the years \u2018Kasteel van Mesen\u2019 has been built and destroyed many times, what remains from this building dates mainly from the early 17th century. In the middle of a 7 hectare park. Also the castle has a lot of outbuildings like stables and an orangery. The site was abandoned in 1972. In 1999 there were plans to demolish the castle for parking space, today they are demolishing the buildings to built a new home for the elderly. Plans for restoration were mentioned, but the time hasn\u2019t been gentle to the building. Many parts were collapsed; the castle could not be saved. I visited \u2018Kasteel van Mesen\u2019 in 2005 and 2006.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact | privacy | faq\n",

The site was divided in two parts; firstly a health-resort, north of the rail racks. Secondly this sanatorium at the south side. Both parts had separate buildings for man and for woman.\nDuring the First World War the sanatoriums were used as military hospital by the Red Cross. Until 1919 more than 12,5 thousand soldiers were nursed in Beelitz. One of these patients was the wounded soldier Adolf Hitler. Not only he was shot in the leg, also he was blinded by mustard gas at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.\n\nTuberculosis sufferers, required plenty of fresh air as well as bed-rest in peaceful surroundings. For this reason the sanatorium had several wards and open-air verandas running the entire length of one side. In the center is an impressive staircase. Also there is a huge exercise hall.\nDuring the cold war the sanatoriums remained military restricted area and accommodated a military hospital of the Soviet troops. Interestingly, this particular building was not exclusively for military use, nor was it exclusively for male patients during Soviet occupation. Evidently a wing of this pavilion was set aside to treat children, presumably those of military personnel.\n\nIn 1994 the Soviets left the hospital and the site is given back at the city of Berlin. Eventually in 2015 the sanatorium is cleaned and painted. Consequently all the Soviet murals in the exercise hall are now hidden beneath a thick layer of paint.

There were plans for eight lines and 69 stations radiating from a central loop downtown.Charleroi is the largest city and municipality of Wallonia, the agglomeration has a population of around 500.000 inhabitants, this makes it the fifth largest agglomeration of the country.\nIn 1974 they started building the lines; however 15 years later, only three lines are in use. The Petria line, a part of the Gilly line, and three-quarters of the loop were actually built and opened to traffic. The high costs of construction, together with a decline in Charleroi\u2019s traditional industries, and questioning of profitability, are all mentioned as reasons for not succeeding the original plan.

Neuville, Chet, Pensee, Centenaire, Champeau, Corbeau, Trieux and last station Ch\u00e2telet. The first 4 stations are all ready for use, but the costs to maintain a line were too high. The underground station Centenaire, finished in 1985, is the last station were rails and electricity lines are installed. From here starts a long concrete trench filled with garbage, trees and bushes. The last stations are nothing more than concrete structures.

It was the only permanently entertainment park in the DDR.\nA special attraction was the Ferris Wheel of Berlin, which was replaced in 1989 with a new, larger version with 36 cars and rising to a height of 45 meters. For many years this was a landmark in the surrounding area. In DDR times the park attracted up to 1.7 million visitor per year.\nFrom 1991, after the fall of the Berlin wall, the park is called Spreepark, named after the Spree river. Some new attractions were added and visitor numbers reached 1.5 million per year. Later the concept was changed. The park was transformed gradually to a recreational park on a more western model. From now on an admission was charged for the park, instead for each roundabout. The asphalted surface around the ferris wheel was taken up and converted into a water landscape. Roller coasters, two game water courses, a stage, a Western village and an English village were later added to the park.\nSince 1999 the park has had to cope with large debts. The increase in the admission fee and a lack of parking space contributed to a drop in visitor numbers until in 2001 only 400,000 visitors entered the park. On 18 January 2002 the owner and closest coworkers left for Lima in Peru. They shipped six attractions in 20 ship containers, having been allowed to do so by the authorities who believed they were being sent for repair.\n\nDuring the year 2002 the park is closed. In August 2002 the park was declared completely bankrupt. Debts at a level of 11 million euro remained and the park was allowed to fall into disrepair.

The tower served as a prison, there are still iron rings in the basement today.\nIn 1449 a chapel was added to the donjon, and later more buildings formed the castle as it is today.

These rooms were tastefully decorated with old Belgian and Rhine furniture, with tapestries and paintings. In the dining room there\u2019s a giant chimney with bas-relief in albast. The staff rooms are in the northern wing. In the hall there is a monumental wooden staircase that leads to the first floor, the private quarters of the master.\nNewer wings were built and in 1865 a coach house with rooms for the personnel on the first floor. Next to this was the hunter\u2019s lodge. After the hunting party, hunters could come here and drink beer and brandy and smoke cigars while they exchanged hunting stories. The horse stables are luxuriously equipped with marble troughs. Next to these are several coach garages. To bad these buildings are heavily damaged due to the weather.\nIt is claimed that Charles V came to the castle for hunting and was accompanied by his son Don Juan, later king of Spain and governor-general of the Netherlands during the Spanish Fury. Also Prince Willem of Oranje-Nassau was a guest at the castle. In the 19th century the donjon was used as an inn for the farmers who came to pay their lease. During the First World War the Germans, who destroyed and stole a great deal of treasures and artwork, occupied the castle. Besides the castle, the stables, a house for the priest there is also a swimming pool, a tennis field and a huge park. In 1992 the last owner left Kasteel Ter Meeren.

Until the late 1960\u2019s the city was the world centre for this industry.\nHoedhaar imported specific breeds of rabbit to produce felt for its famous hats. After the animals were brought into the factory, the first process was to remove the fur from the rabbit, cut open the skin and remove the ears and feet. The second process was in hands of the female employees working in the factories. The wind hair from the animals was cleared off the skin and used as pillow filling. Only the underfur of the animals was used, because only this fur was suitable for the matting process involved in felt making.\nAfter these first two steps, it went to the male employees, the hatters. They did the more dangerous work. The tanning process, with chemicals like mercury, turned the skins into fur. It involved as many kinds of chemical as cloth. Breathing in these fumes is very unhealthy, but for the hatter it was just one of the hazards of the trade. Working in poorly ventilated workshops caused symptoms like trembling, loss of memory and mood swings. In fact the brain damage caused by inhalation drove a good number of them out of their minds. Hence the term The Mad Hatter.\nOut of the 35 factories, there is only one active hat factory left in Lokeren. Changes in both fashion and environmental laws ended most of the trade after the 1960s. In recent years, many of the traditional hat factories have been faced with closure as a result of cheaper imports from both the Eastern block countries as well as the Far East.\nThe site consisted of a street with two large buildings on both sides and some smaller ones at the end. The buildings were not in good shape, but there were still some machinery there. You can still recognize the blower machines in one of the rooms. Eventually the site was demolished in 2009 and the first houses were build on these grounds in 2014.

About 4000 people from 50 nationalities lived in this Olympic Village during the games. The architect Werner Mach designed the village as well as the Olympic stadium by order of Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler. They started building in 1933 and within 2 years there were 150 buildings, a gym, swimming pool and a football field ready.\n\nThe site consisted of one and two-floor dormitories, a large dining hall named \u2018Speisesaal der Nationen\u2019, a swimming pool, gymnasium, running track, and other training facilities. \n\nHitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism. German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods. Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime.\nAfter the Olympics the site is transformed to a military hospital, named the \u2018Olympia-Lazarett D\u00f6beritz\u2019. Also until 1945 it was used as an Army Infantry School before the Soviet army took over the site. During the Cold War it became part of the L\u00f6wen-Adler Kaserne. The Soviet soldiers and families lived in the old Olympic Village until the fall of the iron curtain in 1992. The place was left abandoned until 2004. The city of Berlin started to restore the buildings to its old glory. Today the village is a nice open air museum worth the visit.

But outside of Germany the inner German border crossing was most often referred to by the name that was given to it by the Allies: \u2018Checkpoint Alpha\u2019. The border crossing existed from 1945 to 1990 and was situated between the villages Marienborn and Helmstedt.\nThe first Allied checkpoint at Helmstedt was opened on 1 July 1945 between the British and Soviet zones. The crossing was the largest and most important border crossing on the inner German border during the division of Germany. It was the shortest route between West Germany and West Berlin. The checkpoint marked the beginning of a 170 km long route along a walled or fenced motorway through East Germany, between West Germany and West Berlin. During the Berlin Blockade, which lasted from June 1948 to May 1949, the Soviet checkpoint was closed.\nFrom 1950 onwards, the \u2018Grenztruppen der DDR\u2018 carried out the border control on the eastern side of the checkpoint. The Soviets however handled Allied military traffic. Due to the increasing tensions between the Western Allies and the Soviets during the Cold War, the border crossing was extensively expanded and security was tightened in the following years. The Western Allies kept control over their checkpoint on the western side, with small garrisons of French, British and American troops stationed in Helmstedt.\nThe original checkpoint was eventually regarded too unsafe to operate efficiently. In 1973, the DDR erected a new control point on a 35ha field situated on a hill near Marienborn. It was situated about 1.5 km east of the old buildings. The control point was staffed with up to 1.000 passport control, customs and border police employees. The buildings were linked with an underground tunnel system through which military or police units could reach the control point quickly and in secrecy.

During the year 1841 a new law changed this. In 1849 the psychiatric hospital \u2018Meer en Berg\u2019 was opened to cure the mental sick. This hospital was the first one on the mainland of Europe, it was based upon the English \u201cno restrain\u201d methods where chains and other physical punishments were banned. The hospital was initially intended for 250 patients. Already one year after opening, the institute was struggling with a bed shortage. 315 people were nursed in January 1852. Expansion plans were made, aiming at increasing the number of beds up to 460.\nIn 1888 \u2018Meer en Berg\u2019 had 1217 patients. In 1918 the name \u2018Meer en Berg\u2019 changed to \u2018Provinciaal Ziekenhuis Santpoort\u2019. Since 1953 the number of patients has been 1518. In addition to the two main buildings of the hospital, intended for the nursing of patients, more buildings were built on the hospital grounds.

The Covina factory closed in 1996 and was demolished 10 years later.\nThe mill was built by the De Lieve family. At the time, the factory had a weaving room with 30 looms and 50 workers. The looms were steam driven.\nAt the end of 1913 the company went bankrupt and thereupon in July 1914 the entire complex was bought by the van Damme brothers. In fact they brothers were also active in Eeklo, where they had a wool weaving mill. As a result new buildings were added in the 1920s and the factory was renamed Covina.\n\nIn the years between the two World Wars, the labor force increased remarkably: from 147 workers in 1974 to 754 in 1940. Consequently the company became the largest weaving mill in Eeklo. Here mainly wool and woolen fabrics were made for the industry, both carded and combed. The importance of the wool industry was even greater during the interwar years than before. As a result new halls were added to the site in Eeklo both in 1933 and in 1949.\n\nA new spinning mill was built after the second World War by architect Rottiers. In addition the mill was enlarged in 1951. More recent expansion gave the factory its current look, the buildings were mainly built in 1961 and at the beginning of the 1970s. In reality only a few walls of the original buildings remain.\nEventually the textile mill was taken over by UTO, short for \u2018Usines Textiles d\u2019Oudenaarde\u2019 in the 1990\u2019s. A re-organization so it could compete with the Asian textile industry put an end to Covina. The production stopped from one day on the next.

Eventually most of the production was taken over by the Ruien power station in 1958. Due to the limited cooling capacity of the canal, the plant could not expand further and was increasingly used as a back-up power plant. The plant produced electricity until 1962 and then became a steam plant for neighboring industry and homes. Steam production stopped in 2001.

The company was founded in 1877 in Antwerpen. It went bankrupt in 1994.\nShipyard Beliard starts building ships in Oostende in 1923. The first years the company focussed on building fishing boats. Later it also built for the pilot services and they made boats that were used as a beacon.\nEventually between 1945 and 1983, about 132 ships were built on this shipyard, all in steel except for a few wooden minesweepers for the Navy. In addition to the minesweepers, several ships were built for the government. However, most of the production was steel trawlers. In 1947, more than 700 people were employed. In 1960 this number had dropped to less than 300 and in 1994 only 150 remained. The name of the yard changed several times, in 1961 to Beliard Murdoch and in 1983 to Mercantile-Beliard.\nIn the 1955 Beliard Oostende merged with Crighton and in the 1980s. And later when they switched from steal boats to building polyester boats, they merged with Mercantile. Meanwhile between 1983 and 1990, ten glass fiber reinforced polyester mine hunters were built in the harbor of Oostende.\nIn 1994, the company, now transformed into Beliard Polyship, went bankrupt in the absence of new orders. As a result the city demolished the shipyard in 2007 and prepared the site for new harbor activities.

Trembleur was the first coal mine in the area, it was built by industrialist Gaspar Corbesier in 1799. This marks the beginning of the industrial coal working. Corbesier\u2019s descendants started a second pit in Argenteau close to Trembleur. In 1883 the mine companies of Trembleur and Argenteau merged to one big coal mining company. In 1887 the activities stop because the company is put into liquidation.\n\nDuring the First World War the mine was abandoned and the shafts were flooded to prevent that the German Army would take over the mine. In 1919, mining starts again by the family Ausselet. In 1925 they started to use pneumatic drills and horses for underground transport. As a result the production grows rapidly and reaches 84.000 tons in 1931.\nThe Second World War stopped the coal digging again. The shaft tower and the clock tower were blasted in 1940 to prevent it to be used by the enemy as an observation post. It took 3 years before the tower was rebuilt and active again. Production reaches 232.000 tons. The mine employed 680 mineworkers. \nIn 1958 the coal demand declined. The Belgium mines had a hard time surviving this crisis. Every year a new mine was closed. The last one, \u2018Charbonnage d\u2019Argenteau-Trembleur\u2019 closes on March 31st, 1980. The Province of Li\u00e8ge bought the mine and the buildings were transformed as a museum with the name \u2018Blegny Mine\u2018. The first visitors arrived in June 1980.

The success of this product line, which was sold in specialist shops, made the family business grow into one of the most important companies of Aalst.\nDuring the 1960\u2019s, the factory employed more than 600 people and was the Belgian market leader in this field. In 1970 the firm extended her product gallery with panties. Above this, the brand Minouche was created. In the late 1970\u2019s, the factory covered an area of more than 1,5 ha. In the early 1980\u2019s, the success of the factory stopped. The fashion changed, the production costs went higher and the profits decreased. On the first of March 2001, Du Parc had to close the doors, because of the high debt of 17.5 million Euros.

The brewery was part of tavern where hunters came to rest after a day of hunting at the hunting ground of the counts of Leuven. The brewery is named after the hunters horn.\nWith the presence of students after the establishment of the University of Leuven in 1425 and because of the poor quality of the contaminated available drinking water, Brouwerij Den Hoorn is flourishing.\n\nDuring the 15th century the company grows into one of the largest companies in the city. Those days, a Leuvenaar easily drinks 300 to 440 liters of beer a year, because drinking beer was healthier than water. In 1537 Den Hoorn became the most important enterprise in the city. S\u00e9bastien Artois became Master Brewer in Den Hoorn in 1708. He bought the brewery nine years later and named it \u2018Brouwerij Artois\u2019. He kept the horn logo. The brewery would be handed over from father to son for more than a century. Grandson Leonard Artois bought two other breweries in Brussels for the expansion. At the time of the First French Empire, Artois was the largest brewery in the entire empire. Leonard Artois dies childless in 1814. His sister Johanna-Maria Artois will become the last Artois in the company.\nIn 1922, this brewery is built after a design by architect L. Monnoyer. The very first Stella Artois is brewed in this building as Christmas beer. The name \u2018Stella Artois\u2019 is an amalgamation of the Latin word for \u2018star\u2019 and the name of the founder of the brewery, Sebastiaan Artois. The beer is such a success that it remains permanently on the market.\n\nIn the 1990s the Stella Artois brewery moved to the other side of the Leuven Canal and the old Den Hoorn brewery is left abandoned. During our visit the old copper beer cuves are covered in dust.The abandoned buildings of the former Brewery Den Hoorn were bought in 2007 and completely renovated while retaining the old brewing installation. The building was given a new use as a business complex from October 2012. I took these photos of \u2018Brouwerij Den Hoorn\u2019 in 2005.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

		"description": "The \u2018Anco Pasta\u2019 factory was built in the early 1930\u2019s. The company from founder Antoine Coppens has a rich history. It produced several pasta varieties such as macaroni and spaghetti. Today the site is reconverted to a living area.\nIn 1922 Antoine Coppens bought an old milk factory in Turnhout and converted it into a compound feed factory. Business went so well that in 1930 he bought land at the Nieuwe Bassin, the turning basin in the canal northwest of Turnhout. A  new oil and pastry factory and a fully mechanized flour mill were built along the Dessel-Schoten canal.\nDuring the Second World War, the factory buildings suffered extensive damage, it took two years to resume production. After a thorough study of the most modern production methods in Italy and Switzerland, a pasta section was established two years later. A semolina mill, which supplied the raw materials for these pasta, was inaugurated shortly afterwards. Later a rusk factory was started in 1960. In 1975 Anco merged with Remy and the factory in Turnhout was expanded. During half a century, the workforce had grown from three to three hundred employees.\nThe animal feed factory burned down in 1981 and was not rebuild. Anco focused on its pasta production and eventually became a market leader in Belgium.\nDuring the 1990\u2019s the Dutch CSM group bought the factory. In 1998, the production of pasta was moved to other factories and the Anco site was reconverted to a flour, semolina and breadcrumb production plant. The American company Heinz bought the company in 2001 together with other CSM companies. The Americans soon made it clear that they wanted to get rid of the factory in Turnhout. They started negotiations with heirs of Antoine Coppens, but there was no new buyer found.\nThe pasta factory closed in the summer of 2002. In 2005 Soubry buys the Anco brand. The factory complex stood empty for more than ten years until plans were developed to transform the Nieuwe Bassin from an industrial area to a residential area. Today the buildings are reconverted to 120 single and family apartments, offices and shops. I visited the pasta company in 2005.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

		"description": "In this area the Romans already used limestone taken from open air quarries to make building materials. In the early 15th century the first underground quarries were used to gain limestone. During the early 16th century most of the quarries of the \u2018Plateau van Caestert\u2019 were built. \nThe \u2018Plateau van Caestert\u2019 quarry features huge hallways which reach heights up to 15m and there are many old and new drawings. The old drawings were made using oil-lamps. The drawings were dated by scientists and are approximately from the 14th-15th century. During my visit I found a drawing dated 1468, but others are probably much older.\nIn the Dutch part of the plateau a large part, about 70%, of these corridors has been lost by the ENCI quarry. There are still four major corridors that each have their own character: the Northern Corridor, Quarry Zonneberg and Slavante and the Southern Corridor. In the Belgian northern part the three largest quarries are: Quarry Caestert, Ternaaien-Boven, -Midden and \u2013Beneden.\nCaestert is a large quarry. It\u2019s approximately 900 by 600m in size. There is a gigantic centre part with hundreds of hallways going in every direction. It was very complicated to navigate in there, we would probably still wander there if we went alone. The centre part was deepened to get marl dust which resulted in two different levels. After that the excavation slowed down and finally came to a full stop around 1850. After that the loose marl material was scratched of the walls and digged out of the floors, creating extra high hallways, to be used for agricultural purposes.\nThe Caestert quarry is connected to the remains of the now collapsed quarry Zuid. Only a few hallways are left. During the Second World War the Dutch/Belgium resistance smuggled people and illegal stuff through here. The Germans did patrols in the quarries. Because they did not know their way around they needed a guide to help them. The guide happened to be no stranger to the resistance so they never caught any smugglers.. Since the late 1970\u2019s the whole area has been designated nature reservation. Before that the Belgium cement industry was planning on digging away the complete area. For a while it was closed down with walls but soon reopened by the \u2018underground\u2019 people. Currently there are rumours that it will be closed up again soon.

Customers could buy a cup of chocolate and various types of candy, for example chocolate pastilles. Droste Cacao established a grand reputation in these early years and as a result, the first factory of the firm \u2018G.J. Droste Cacao\u2019 opened its doors in 1890.\nSince 1891 \u2018Droste Cacao\u2019 had been able to allocate the complete chocolate process in-house. Cocoa beans were stored in the loft, while sales took place in the retail store. Because the buildings soon became too small. The factory was relocated to the Noorder Buiten Spaarne in 1891. It was in this plant were the production of cocoa and chocolate started. This waterside location was very advantageous for Droste, enabling the delivery of raw materials and the transport of finished products by boat.\nDuring the Second World War a bombing by an Allied aircraft, caused considerable damage to parts of the Droste site. As a result, production and sales of Droste declined rapidly and eventually stopped. Five years after the War, Droste was once again able to supply quality products to the Dutch and foreign market.\nProduction of Droste Cacao was transferred to Vaassen in 1986. The old production location in Haarlem continued as \u2018Dutch Cocoa & Chocolate Company B.V.\u2019 The new factory produced products of the Venz brand, mainly chocolate sprinkles. The old factory is abandoned in 2004 and reconverted into housing in 2006. I visited \u2018Droste Cacao\u2019 in 2006.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

		"description": "\u2018Blauwselfabriek Jacob Avis\u2019 was an abandoned factory in Westzaan, close to Amsterdam. The factory produced the bluing. Today the factory is gone.\nBluing is a household product used to improve the appearance of textiles, especially white fabrics. Used during laundering, it adds a trace of blue dye to the fabric. White fabrics acquire a slight color cast after use, adding a trace of blue color to the slightly off-white color of these fabrics makes them appear whiter.\nThere have been only a few bluing mills in the Netherlands. In fact most of these mills were located in Zaandijk and Westzaan.\nThis factory was first mentioned in 1701. The first factory is a mill propelled by horses. By melting cobalt ore with glass, the dark blue pigment smalt was obtained. The special blue paint colored the mill and horses blue, because of the dust that was released by the production. In fact this is how the factory was given its nickname \u2018De Blauwe Hengst\u2019 or in English \u2018The Blue Stallion\u2019. In 1759 the mill merged with the other bluing mill in Westzaan, De Meijer. But after the French occupation business went downhill and the De Meijer mill was demolished.\nIn 1824 the company was sold to starch manufacturer Cornelis Avis. From 1833 Avis took up the production of litmus. For this purpose, a steam engine was installed and a stone chimney was erected at De Blauwe Hengst. Litmus was used as a dye for textiles at that time. The raw materials for litmus were lichens treated in urine. This was collected from the residents of the city. The people received a small compensation for this. Because of the production of this litmus, De Blauwe Hengst was given the nickname Piss Mill. However, it did not harm the company, the litmus production was very profitable. Other new products from Avis were cheese coloring and turret blue.\n\nWith the growth of the company, the capacity of the old mill soon became too small. In 1848, De Blauwe Hengst was demolished and a new mill was built in its place. In 1917 this was changed to \u2018NV Verffabrieken Avis\u2019. Over the years, the blue factory grew bigger and bigger and all wooden factory buildings were replaced by a brick buildings. In addition to bluing and litmus, other chemical dyes were produced at Avis. Eventually \u2018Verffabrieken Avis\u2019 went bankrupt in 1969. The buildings were later taken into use by a car wrecker.\nDuring my visit, 300 years after the first mill was built, I am documenting its last week. Most of the factory is already turned to dust. Al what\u2019s left is blue concrete. During the demolition in 2006 they found 10 millstones in the ground, the last ode to the Blue Stallion from Westzaan.

It had a marketshare of 20% in Belgium and 2% in the European Union. The company had 735 employees working in the three factories in Ghlin, Jumet and Mol. The bottle glass industry suffered a crisis in the 1960s. However the company survived this period well. A new crisis emerged in the 1970s. In 1978, prices collapsed by around fifty percent. Verlipack went bankrupt in 1985.\n\nVerlipack was taken over in 1987 by the Beaulieu Group, owned by the West-Flemish carpet manufacturer Roger De Clerck. Later that year the Belgium government became 49% owner of Verlipack. At the same time De Clerck is suspected of large-scale fraud by means of fictitious money transactions; he would have sent an estimated 1.5 billion francs abroad. In 1995 and 1996 Verlipack incurred substantial losses due to bad management and in particular to the low quality of its production. As a result the government sold their part of the company to the German Heye Glas in 1996. The new management was, despite investments, not able to obtain better product quality.\nOn January 18, 1999, another bankruptcy sealed the fate of Verlipack Jumet, it was terrible news for the 187 employees of the company. The Jumet site was abandoned, the other sites were sold and re-used by other companies.

Drake drilled the first oil well in Pennsylvania in the United States. Two years later, the port of Antwerp \u2013 located at that time near the city centre \u2013 functioned as the European distribution hub for petroleum, which at that time was transported in wooden barrels. By 1863, Antwerp was the largest oil importer in Europe. In 1887 a huge fire engulfed the petroleum installations, with 52 lives lost, 42 missing, and the destruction of the city\u2019s warehouses. Moreover, oil was being delivered more and more in bulk which required wharves to which the ships could moor. This is how the historical area of the Hoboken Polder, just south of the city, came into the picture.\nIn 1904 the wharf was built, and on 16 August the first oil tanker moored. By the end of 1904, the basic infrastructure on 30 hectares of the terrain had been completed. In 1914 further expansion of the area began. But the First World War put a spanner in the works. From 1919, the petroleum port took off again, with some 233 petroleum tanks on the site by the end of the 1920s. A final expansion occurred in 1934.\nInitially the oil was pumped from the pier to the facilities on site through underground pipes. But soon multiple leaks occurred that allowed large amounts of oil to leak into the ground, causing severe pollution of the area. After lengthy discussions, the leaking underground pipes were replaced from 1937 to 1939 by aboveground pipes. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the dynamic of Petroleum South was ruined. At the end of the 1940s, new dock were built to the north of the city. From that point, the centre of Antwerp\u2019s oil industry was in the north. In 1953, 4,3 million tons of oil were processed in Antwerp, with only 405.000 tons of this at \u2018Petroleum Zuid\u2019.

This factory was the first cokes plant in The Netherlands.\nFor the Dutch region Zeeuws-Vlaanderen coke factory \u2018ACZC\u2019 was the first non-food industry in the area.

During the first years of production, the coal supplies ran out because of the First World War. Also the Second World War gave the company big problems. The allies bombed the electricity hall and consequently the company had to shut down. Later in 1945 all machinery was taken to Gemrany by the retreating German troops. New production started eventually five years later. Since then the future looked brighter, the economy went up and \u2018ACZC Sluiskil\u2019 made good profit.

A partial reconstruction was carried out during the war. The work was resumed in parts of the halls after cleanup. Early in 1945, 11 from the 55 tracks were in use again. More damage to the buildings was done at the end of the war when the German soldiers blew up ammunition trains near the workshop.\nIn the time of the DDR, different consumer products were made from unnecessary waste materials. The workshop produced handles for shavers, hammers, wooden fences and parts for agriculture uses such as plowshares. Later, garden furniture, tableware and chisel were manufactured. Until 1990, it produced also drive shafts for the Trabant. All these products were discontinued after 1989. The number of employees has risen up to 2,000 people during the 1980s. But everything changed during the 1990s. Activities were modernized and departments were moved to another location. In 1998 the site closes down. Parts of the plant are protected. But other buildings will be demolished so the big area can be redeveloped.

He was better known under his stage name Farinelli. The palace was built by the architect Giacomo Bonavia who also built the royal palace \u2018Palacio Real de Aranjuez\u2019.\nFarinelli, born in 1705 and past away in 1782, was a celebrated Italian opera singer. He was the favorite singer of King Philip V and his cultural advisors. Farinelli is widely regarded as the greatest, most accomplished and most respected opera singer of the castrato era, which lasted from the early 1600s into the early 1800s. After he died, the building is bought by the Duke of Osuna. He asks the famous architect Juan de Villanueva, who just finished building the Prado Museum, to expand his palace with a new wing in 1795.\nThe palace continued in the hands of the dukes until the late nineteenth century, when the XII Duke, had to sell it. The property is divided into two parts, the ground floor is acquired by Juan Richer Turi\u00f3n , during those times mayor of Aranjuez.\nIn May 2018 there was a huge fire at the abandoned palace. The intense fire caused the roof to collapse. Eight fire crews were trying to prevent the flames spreading to neighbouring properties. The palace itself was lost. The neoclassical building had been valued at 1.5 million euros before the fire. Currently the palace is still on sale in several Russian websites with different prices of more than 3 million euros. These photos of \u2018Palacio de Osuna\u2019 were taken in 2012.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

However in 1950 it was branded Heinrich Heine, named after Christian Johann Heinrich Heine. He was not only a German poet and journalist, he also was a literary critic.\nSoviet officers were reported to have lived quite extravagantly in the complex after the Second World War. Due to its proximity to the East-West German border, the hotel could only be visited by permit, and all guests had to wear ID tags at all times, however the hotel continued to be quite popular. As a result rooms were often sold out, typically by government officials and wealthy businessmen.\nAfter the reunification of Germany in the 1990s, the high-class guests, as well as the DDR parent company\u2019s funds, vanished into thin air. The resort limped through the next few years operating as a Travel Hotel until 1994, when it was finally closed for good. The hotel and its land were sold at an auction during the year 2007 for 43 thousand euro. I visited \u2018Grandhotel Heinrich Heine\u2019 in 2011. The building was demolished in July 2016.

In fact these giants can load 20 thousand kilogram and can reach a speed op 295 km/h. The helicopter was designed by Marat Tishchenko, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mikhail Mil, founder of the OKB-329 design bureau. OKBs were closed institutions working on design and prototyping of advanced technology, usually for military applications.\nAnother version of this aircraft, the \u2018MI-26S\u2019 was a quickly developed version for disaster relief tasks immediately after the Chernobyl disaster at the Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.\n\nThese helicopters where transported from the airports of Bierset and Gosselies to the harbor of Zeebrugge. Normally the machines had to be shipped to Russia, but due of financial problems they are stuck at the site of the transport company. I photographed the \u2018Skytech Helicopters\u2019 in 2010.

Nobody can say exactly where its history started. All that is certain is that the brewery, belonging to Gut L\u00fctzschena was granted the privilege in 1785 of being allowed to sell its beer in Leipzig \u201cbecause of its strength and quality\u201d. But the history of Sternburg probably goes all the way back to 1278, when it was first brewed in Rittergut. Maximillian Speck, who bought the property, moved the brewery to Leipzig. While 12 thousand hectoliters of beer were brewed in 1883, the demand soon outstripped supply. A new steam boiler, ice and cooling machines were therefore purchased in 1888 to increase production.\nIn 1890 a new brewhouse with steam cooking was put into operation, new fermentation vats and storage casks had to be used. In 1906, the bottle cellar and the cold store were expanded, the brewery started to brew the well-known Sternburg beer. Sternburg is better known as Sterni.\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, the annual beer production was 250 thousand hectoliters. After the war, in 1948 the brewery became a state-owned enterprise, as was common under the government of the DDR. In 1989, 500 thousand hectoliters of beer were produced in the brewery by 500 employees. Eventually after the German re-unification in 1990, it became an independent venture again. However, with the end of the DDR it was also the end of the brewery. On August 31, 1991, the brewery was closed despite the occupation by employees and the objections of the local council.\n\nMeanwhile the business was sold by Sachsenbr\u00e4u. Not much later the new owner closed the brewery at L\u00fctzschena, continuing production at their Reudnitzer Brewery. In 2006 it had 9.5% of the market share in the eastern provinces of Germany.

In 1679 the State Ammunition Company in Delft was established.\nIn 1887 the company was renamed \u2018Artillerie Inrichtingen\u2019. Production was no longer centered in Delft because the company\u2019s existing site had no space left to expand. The company chose a new base of operations near Zaandam. In 1907, a gangway bridge was opened over the canal called Hembrug. Eventually the name of the bridge would pass on the company.\nDuring the First World War the factory had almost 8.500 people working. After the war the future was uncertain, as a result the employees were brought back to two thousand. In 1928, the organization of the company was changed to that of a public limited company which allowed for greater freedom of business management. During the Second World War the factory was almost bombed to prevent the take-over of the German occupation. But the place was not bombed and as a result the German army took over. The Nazis kept the plants working during the war, but the workforce fell sharply. \nAfter the war the factory was restarted, but instead of ammunition it produced agricultural machinery and other metal products. In 1973 the Dutch government divided the company into two independent parts: Eurometaal and Hembrug Machine Tools. Eurometaal was eventually taken over by the German Rheinmetall and stopped production in 2003.

Two years later, the two businessmen separate their companies again, Bleichert runs its own company in which he produces cable cars, under a new name.\nIn 1881 Bleichert relocated the entire company to Gohlis, new factory rooms were inaugurated, and the 100th cable car was built. At this time, 90 employees work in the company. In 1897 the factory is enlarged, new administration buildings are built, the workforce grows to 200 workers. In 1899 the company celebrates its 25th anniversary and the 1000th cable car is completed.\nIn the spring of 1900 Adolf Bleichert suffers from tuberculosis with no prospect of recovery. After Bleichert\u2019s death in 1901, all proposals were implemented by Karl Streitzig, the factory was enlarged and separated into two sections. The longest and highest cable car produced was sold to Chilecito-La Mejicana in Argentina. The 34-kilometer airway was built in 1903 on behalf of the Argentine government. It was used to transport copper and silver ore from the mines. It goes up to the mountain station at 4603 meters altitude and overcomes a height difference of 3500 meters.\nDuring the First World War, Bleichert rails were used at the front for transport of ammunition, food and wounded soldiers. From 1919 to 1922, new production halls were built in Eutritzsch, as there are already residential buildings all around the site in Gohlis and the factory can not expand here. During this time, Bleichert\u2019s company becomes increasingly important for the construction of passenger cable cars. In 1930 the company went bankrupted by the global economic crisis, but in 1932 a successor was found.

The clinic had space for 30 patients and was open for the more wealthy people.\n\nDuring the year 1906 it was connected to the central heating and power supply. This made the Eichhof a very modern institute.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, the now abandoned sanatorium was used by the Wehrmacht as a military psychiatric hospital. Like so many other sanatoriums at that time, the Eichhof was also used for the crimes of the Nazi regime. After the Second World War, the British military government housed mentally ill people here. Since 1950 the old clinic served as a home for men with a mental disability or a mild mental illness.

The administration and manufacturing buildings of B\u00fccker were built in the eastern part of the airfield area, including a guardhouse, a canteen and a social building with sports field.

It was a development centre for future weapons, and also an artillery range.\nIn 1875 the German government signed a contract with the forest service of Prussia for the transfer of the land near the village of Kummersdorf to built a military research center and test range. Also a special military railway was built to connect the site with Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg. It was to be maintained by special railway troops. The 45,5 kilometer line was officially opened in 1875, with two trains running daily between the range and the city. Not restricted to military operations, the service was also open to the general public.\nIn the meantime, the artillery test range near Kummersdorf grew during the 1880s, extending around 13 kilometers through an uninhabited pine forest. The site was further expanded at the beginning of the 20th century to accommodate testing of the newest weapons in the run up to the First World War. Among them the infamous Big Berta gun and bomb-carrying airships. The end of the First World War in 1918 should have been the end of the shooting range. The Treaty of Versailles forbade the Germans to develop new weapons. But instead, the secrecy was tightened on the site. Part of the site was a test site for tanks and trucks, the \u2018Versuchsstelle f\u00fcr Kraftfahrt\u2019 and the Chemical-Physical and Atomic Research Station \u2018Versuchsstelle Gottow\u2019.\nBy the end of the 1920s, the German military prepared Kummersdorf as test site for yet another type of promising technology: the rocket. An Army research group developed the liquid propellant rockets type A1, A2 and A3 in 1932. On 16 July 1934 Dr. Kurt Wahmke and two assistants were killed and another assistant injured when the fuel tank exploded during a fuel test of a premixed hydrogen peroxide/alcohol propellant.\nThe facility was too limited for advanced motor and flight testing, so in 1936 the group moved to a site at Peenem\u00fcnde on the Baltic coast which offered much greater space and secrecy. From 1938 onwards, the site was used for nuclear research by the Wehrmacht. After the Second World War the secrecy in Kummersdorf did not end. Once again the area became a restricted zone, now the garrisons were occupied by Soviet troops.\nAlso check my report of the nearby Flugplatz Sperenberg.

This Nazi Military complex outside of Berlin wasn\u2019t actually one military base, but two: The Adler Kaserne (Eagle Barracks) and the L\u00f6wen Kaserne (Lion Barracks).\nThe military use of this area began in 1713 with the first field exercises under Friedrich Wilhelm I. But officially the construction of the military training area began in 1892 under Emperor Wilhelm II. At the beginning of the First World War, a prisoner of war camp was set up on the western edge of this site. More than 30.000 prisoners from seven nations were held here until October 1918.\nThe construction of this military site started in 1935. While the L\u00f6wen Kaserne originally served as an infantry teaching regiment, the Adler Kaserne next door, served as a base for Cavalry Units. The site was simply named \u2018Neue Kasernen\u2019 until 1945. The Flugplatz D\u00f6beritz, also located just south of the barracks was used to train new pilots and paratroopers. The L\u00f6wen-Adler Kaserne was used to train and form troops right up until the end of the war\n\nIn 1936 the Olympic Games were held in Berlin, the Olympic village was built on the training site. Check my report on this Olympic Village. The \u2018L\u00f6wen-Adler Kaserne\u2019 gained nationwide notoriety due to the plot to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the current military regime. The plan was codenamed Operation Valkyrie. The attempts failed.\nAfter the war ended in 1945, refugees were temporarily housed there until the Soviet forces took over the entire area and stationed nearly 20.000 soldiers there. Between Elstal and Dallgow a small Soviet city with schools, shops, a hospital and a police station was built. While it wasn\u2019t expressly forbidden, there was little contact between the soviet soldiers and the East German Population. Ordinary soldiers were only permitted to leave in groups, and even within the Soviet territory they needed permits to go to other areas inside the camp.\nThe site was abandoned in 1992. Still today a small part of about 800 ha in the south the D\u00f6beritzer moor is used as a training site for Berlin and Potsdam stationed armed forces. The biggest part of the moor is now a listed nature monument. The barracks had become a regular haunt for paint ballers, right wing fanatics and the usual vandals. The Lion Statue which had been taken care of by the Nazis and then the soviets had become a regular target of vandalism and graffiti. A local initiative managed to remove the statue in 2015 and move it to a safe place for restoration. I visited the barracks in 2008.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact \u00b7 privacy \u00b7 faq\n",

The site in the forests was originally developed for the Prussian Army.\nSperenburg was not always an air field, not even during the Nazi-days. The area was originally part of the Heeresversuchsanstalt Kummersdorf, doing research in the usability of military hardware since 1870. Until the Second World War it also served as a training facility for railway pioneers, as shown by the many remnants of bridges and railway tracks. During Second World War it served as a rocket and missile research facility to Dr. Werner von Braun, before he moved to Peenem\u00fcnde.\nIn 1950 the Red Army was looking for an airfield for exclusive military use. It served as a replacement for the military use of Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld that became an airport for civilian flights only. Over time the airfield developed into a Soviet city within East Germany, with schools, shops, movie-theaters, hospitals, and at its peak housed 5.000 military and civilian personnel. Flugplatz Sperenberg has two runways, a concrete 2500 meter long strip and a 1000 meter grass emergency strip.\nThe Soviets made heavy use of Sperenburg: it had both cargo and passenger aircraft (such as An-22 and Il-76) stationed, but also bombers and combat helicopters. When the two German countries were reunited, things changed almost overnight for the Russians. The Soviets operated from the airfield (although severely restricted) until 1994. From 1996 the airport and the surrounding lands, altogether 2.400 hectares of property, were abandoned. In 2009 the property was handed over to the Federal State of Brandenburg, since then Sperenberg is left to the weather, nature and vandals. Luckily it\u2019s protected by Museum Kummersdorf.

The main buildings are built in the national-socialist architecture and have the shape of an airplane.\nIn 1933 the military school was built by the Luftwaffe, the air force of the Reichswehr under the strictest secrecy. Since Germany was not allowed to own an air force under the Treaty of Versailles, it was initially disguised as a civilian institution. During the first years the name of the school was \u2018Technische Schule der Deutschen Verkehrsfliegerschule\u2019. But soon it changed to \u2018Fliegertechnische Schule der Luftflotte 1\u2019.\nAt first the buildings were used for education of engineers and repairman of military aircrafts. Already in the first year 1500 pupils were trained here. First commander of the school was Kurt Student. When the aviation technical school was relocated to Warsaw in 1940, the \u2018H\u00f6here Fliegertechnische Schule\u2019 from Berlin, moved to this forest camp. On the site there was a hangar for aircraft development with its own wind tunnel.\nFrom 1945 to 1992, the site at Altes Lager, was used by the Soviet Army. They set up a training center for officers from the armored troops and artillery. For this reason staircase and corridor walls have been decorated with remarkable Soviet murals ranging from modern agriculture to the peaceful use of space. In 1992, after the fall of the iron curtain, the Soviets eventually left the site. Ever since the buildings have been out of use.\n\nClose to this domain is an old military air field. This \u2018Flugplatz Altes Lager\u2019 is now used for pleasure flights. The buildings are protected monuments.

In 1908 the plant produced 74 thousand ton coke a year. The coke that was produced in this plant was considered one of the most qualitative in Europe. The Company also provides storage services including natural gas storage in underground reservoirs.\n\nEventually coal mining in the Anderlues region stopped in 1969. As a result the cokes plant had to switch to imported coal.\nAfter years of production, the installation became outdated and there was no money left to invest in order to meet the environmental and safety requirements. As a result \u2018Cokeries et Houilleres d\u2019Anderlues\u2019 closed in 2002 and had to let the 113 employees go. The factory was the longest running cokes factory in Belgium. In 2004, a private company bought the place for the operation of a test center for the treatment of minerals. In 2006 restoration of some buildings stopped due to a lack of permits.\n\nPresently the site is a heavily polluted site.

In those years tuberculosis was the number one cause of death, wiping out entire families.\nThe building is designed by the Swiss architect Edwin Wipf, who later also built railway stations of the Centovallibahn in Ticino. The decline of the house was initiated by the chief physician Hanns Alexander, who raised the swastika flags on the sanatorium and founded an NSDAP-Ortsgruppe in Agra. He had Hitler portraits on the wall and denied Jews to the sanatorium. It caused a shock among patients, employees and the local population. But the Swiss authorities did not intervene and allowed him to do so. After the defeat of Germany in 1945, the clinic had fallen into disrepute by Alexander\u2019s activities and could no longer attach to previous successes. The year 1969 was the final closure.\nIn 2004, Ticino entrepreneur Silvio Tarchini bought the total of 400.000 square meters of land for 7 million francs.

But the history of \u2018St. Josefsheim\u2019 starts in 1909 when the \u2018Order of the Franciscans of the Holy Cross\u2019 came to Nordrhein-Westfalen. In only two years they build this complex. Block I, named the \u2018Guardian Angel House\u2019 was a school with bedrooms. In Block II, the \u2018Franziskushaus\u2019, lived the mentally handicapped kids. The third block was named \u2018Antoniushaus\u2019. Here patients with severe disability were accommodated. Block IV was the administration building with cloister and church. The Dusseldorf company Gassen and Blaschke designed the colored stained glass windows of the church. The organ was built in 1922 by Georg Stahlhut.\n\nAbout 600 mentally and physically disabled people were living in the monastery. But after a stop of financial help from the government the order had to leave the buildings. The last of the brothers left the house on 23rd May 1937.\nThe National Socialists questioned certain groups of people\u2019s right to life. In 1939 a new law stated that every disabled new born should be reported to the government. The race purification program killed more than 200.000 people and also in St. Jozefsheim people were killed. The site was renamed \u2018Waldniel Institution\u2019, At least 30 children were murdered through the euthanasia program. In total, more than 500 \u201cpatients\u201d died. Another 1,044 people were transported to other institutions where many of them died. These were the site\u2019s darkest days. In July 1943 the institute left the old monastery and the remaining 183 children were transported to other institutes.\nAfter the Second World War the brotherhood could redeem Hostert at an appropriate price, but they could not lead the community as before, so they sold the buildings to the newly-formed German federation. In 1952 the Allies rented the institute for use as a military hospital. The two original blocks of 1913 were connected with modern corridors. A modern clinic with two surgical, pediatrician and psychiatric departments were developed.\nIn 1963 the Hostert site was converted into a school for the children of British military personnel. During the redevelopment work human bones were discovered \u2013 remains of the patients who died at the institute between 1939 and 1945. At the height of its time as a school it had around 6.000 pupils attending. 270 kids stayed overnight at the boarding school. The other pupils were transported to the school by bus; everyday 50 busses drove to the Kent School. Even a special bus station was added to the site.\nIn 1992 the school closed and the buildings were for sale again. They even came on E-bay, an online marketplace. The last few years there have been some emergency restorations in the buildings to keep them from falling apart. In 2000 the site was purchased by an investor from Dusseldorf.

It was against this background that, from 1901, August Thyssen initiated the building of a blast furnace plant in Meiderich to produce pig iron. Pig iron is smelted with the addition of lime and coke from iron ores. The liquid end product can then be further processed into steel. The plant was supplied with coke directly from the neighboring Thyssen coal mine.\n\nBy 1904, three blast furnaces were built at H\u00fcttenbetriebe Meiderich. The fourth blast furnace was completed in 1907 and the fifth furnace in 1912. In that year the workforce increased to 1350 employees.\n\nThe mid-1970s saw a worldwide steel crisis and overcapacity in the European steel market. Production in the Meiderich works had to be cut back. From 1979 the sales crisis intensified, leading to the closure of blast furnaces 1 and 2 in the early 1980s. Blast furnace 5 remained stand-by but was never fired up again. The last shift was worked on 4 April 1985. The remaining 300 employees were offered alternative jobs in the Thyssen Ruhrort and Hamborn works. Following massive protests the plant was not demolished, but protected as an industrial monument.

The buildings were demolished, but eventually the mine reopened 30 years later in 1907.\n\nThe main building is a typical Malakoff tower, built in 1907. In fact this architecture style was named after a building in the Russian town Sebastopol. Many towers in the German Ruhrgebied have a similar Malakoff look. In detail it looks like an ancient castle with knights firing crossbows to the enemy. But it was in fact a building full of both dressing rooms and showers for the miners. The highest tower housed Shaft 1, it was later used as a rescue shaft. A washhouse was built in 1920 by the Beer de Jemeppe company, and a second extraction mine with a metal tower opened in 1927. A third mine shaft with headframe was built between 1927 and 1947. The deepest shaft is 480 meter deep.\nIt\u2019s strange when you walk through the buildings, everything is just the same as almost 25 years ago when the place was closed down. A newspaper from 1976 tells us the first photos of Mars are taken with the Viking I rocket. Hasard Cheratte was abandoned in just one day. The miners turning up that day for work could turn back immediately, the gate was closed. Sometimes it feels that a miner could walk in to get his coat and hat from his locker, but the coat and hat haven\u2019t been touched for over 25 years. The site was partly demolished and partly reconverted in 2019. I visited \u2018Charbonnage du Hasard Cheratte\u2019 in 2005 and 2007.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact | privacy | faq\n",

In Dutch, Dominicans are also called \u2018Orde der Predikheren\u2019. Hence the name given to the building. Today the monastery is a modern library.\nThe Dominican Order is a Catholic religious order, created by Saint Dominic in the early 13th century. This religious group came to Mechelen in 1651 and in 1652 they obtained permission to establish a monastery with a small chapel. Eventually the monastery and chapel were ready in 1689. Soon the chapel became too small for the Dominicans and a new church was built. The church was inaugurated in 1736 after seven years of building. The monastery was later sold to a religious group that used the monastery as a retirement home for men.\nIn 1796 the French occupiers take the buildings and used them as a training site, a military hospital and military arsenal. The tower of the church was demolished during those years. Finally in 1814, the Allies drove out Napoleon and ended French rule.\nThe monastery keeps its military use until 1977. It first remained a military hospital, the marble floor was broken up and the doors removed. Until the army left the buildings in 1975 it was named \u2018Barracks General Delobbe\u2019. In 1977 the monastery was sold to the city of Mechelen. I took these photos of the \u2018Dominicanen- of Predikherenklooster\u2019 in 2007.Today the old monastery houses the City Library.

Later it was used by the Belgian Air Force as \u2018Building 22\u2019.\nThe castle was built by Jean-Henri-Paul Ulens, a local lawyer and mayor of the city of Sint-Truiden from 1878 until 1891. In 1904, notary and mayor Paul Cartuyvels and his wife Marie Seny bought the estate and used the castle as a country residence until his death in March 1940.\nEventually the castle is added to the neighbouring military site that was built at the beginning of the Second World War by the Germans. Even after the liberation it retained its military purpose. First as an American quarter and later in 1951 the estate was sold to the Belgian state, making it a military domain. In fact it became the Air Force Enforcement Center, the military school of the Belgian Air Force. Rochendaal castle served as an officers home and was for this reason renamed \u2018Building 22\u2019.\nThe castle is a building with many artifacts. For example the beautiful details on the ceiling, the wooden tiger heads on the fireplace and the view on the outside are marvelous.\nIn 1996 the military site is closed down. As a result the building became abandoned and are meanwhile ruined by squatters and thieves. On 13 September 2017, the castle was destroyed by a fire. Even after the fire, the city of Sint-Truiden still wants to take over Chateau Rochendaal and its domain. According to the master plan for the site, the 16 hectares would become residential area and a park.

The site was abandoned in 1992.\nThe quarry is an open-pit mine, in fact it is nothing more than a large hole that, after mining of the minerals, was closed with sand. The factory made Calcium Silicate Bricks or Sand-lime Bricks.\nSand-lime brick is a masonry brick that is formed by pressing a mixture of sand, quicklime and about water into a mold. Subsequently, the bricks are stacked on a platform trolley. Several trollies are driven in a steam boiler, also called an autoclave. After, for example 8 hours, the stones are sufficiently hardened.\n\nIn 1999 the company was taken over by the German Haniel group. In 2004, after 40 years, Steenfabriek Boudewijn had to close its doors. That year the permit to use the quarry in Ossendrecht is no longer continued. During my visit I found there many signs warning for quicksand around the quarry. Officially the pit of 75 hectare should be equalized by the Boudewijn company, but the 10 meter deep quarry will be kept as a nature monument.\nLocal youth who trashed and squatted the place several times put a definitive end to it. They burned down half the factory in June 2006. Several fire engines were needed to put the flames to a stop. After the fire, and because of the many complaints of the neighborhood, the factory was demolished. The former director\u2019s residence has not been demolished and is still on the western side of the terrain. This property may soon become part of the new residential area.

It took until 1926 before the hospital was brought back to its original form. In 1930 the name of the hospital changed from \u2018Militair Instituut voor Zeekuur\u2019 to \u2018Hospitaal Bataljons-Geneesheer Charles-Aim\u00e9 De Beer\u2019, named after the military officer De Beer from Ciney.\nDuring the Second World War the hospital was taken for the second time by the German troops. They didn\u2019t use it as hospital, but as storage this time. After the liberation in 1944, the English restored the domain as a hospital, to nurse their troops. Eventually in 1946 the Belgium government became the owner of the hospital site again. The buildings were repaired and expanded. In addition to the main buildings, a monastery and new hospital wards were built. The modern complex also included gardens and various technical buildings. As part of a structuring plan, the hospital was transformed into an outpatient clinic on January 1, 1990. Not much later in 1993 the army left the buildings and the site was abandoned.\n\nEventually the site was demolished in 2006. However some buildings were renovated and got a new use.

The official name of the castle is \u2018Chateau Miranda\u2019, later named \u2018Home de Noisy\u2019.\nThe first owner of \u2018Miranda\u2019 was Count Liedekerke-Beaufort. During the French Revolution, the family Liedekerke-Beaufort had to leave their home, the Castle of V\u00e8ves. Consequently they had to hide and chose a farm outside the village. After the revolution, the farm became a summer residence for the family and finally turned into this iconic building. Construction was completed in 1907 after the clock tower was erected. The castle was designed by the English architect Edward Milner, although he died before seeing its completion.\nDuring the Second World War a small part of the Battle of the Bulge took place on the property. At that time, the castle was occupied by the Nazis. After the war inherits of the family leave the castle. In 1950 \u2018Chateau Miranda\u2019 was renamed \u2018Home de Noisy\u2019 when it was taken over by the NMBS, the national railway company of Belgium. The railway company used the castle as an orphanage and a holiday camp for sick children. Its function as a children\u2019s camp lasted until the late 1970s. After the 1970s the castle was used for sport and activity camps for children.\nIn 1991 Chateau de Noisy is abandoned. The castle has stood empty and completely abandoned since 1991 because the costs to maintain it were too big. However a search for investors failed. Parts of the structure were heavily damaged in a fire and many areas of the ceiling are collapsing. Despite this, it\u2019s still a beauty. The castle became the most famous urbex location in Europe. Every weekend many photographers visit the small village of Celles to see this classic castle. In 2016 the first plans for demolishing came into the local news. Soon the first protest started to save the castle. I visited this castle in 2005 and 2016. Ch\u00e2teau de Noisy was demolished in 2017 despite the effort of locals to save the site.\n\u00a9 2004-2021\ncontact | privacy | faq\n",

This brewery was founded in 1851, it moved to its current site by Emiel Eylenbosch in 1894.\nThe Lambic beers like Gueuze were brewed here in Schepdaal. Like the Kriek beers, also the Supergueuze beers brewed here, can be found on the lists from beer lovers. The Supergueuze, or affectionately known as \u201cSuperglue\u201d, is a very full and smooth Lambic beer with a three years conditioning prior to bottling. We found some of these old bottles on the attic, they were covered in dust.\nThe in 1894 new built buildings were located around a closed courtyard, with the old brewer\u2019s house centrally located. To the west, next to the brewer\u2019s house, there was a storage facility, dating 1893, and at the south side was the old brewery. Around 1930 the old brewery was partially rebuilt, in 1932 the owner built a new brewers house. At the same time the tower was built to update the production process.\nThe brewery was acquired in 1989 by Brouwerij de Keersmaeker, known for its brand Mort Subite. Later Eylenbosch is taken over by Alken Maes, since then the site has been seriously neglected. Since 2004, the site has been abandoned by brewery Alken Maes. The installations remained untouched until the beginning of the 21st century, but the brewery is currently completely dismantled. \u2018Brouwerij Eylenbosch\u2019 was used in 2005 as decor for a movie.

The beautiful building designed by Maxime Brunfaut was built in 1936 for the socialist insurance company La Pr\u00e9voyance Sociale.\nThe sanatorium was designed to accommodate 150 male patients. Its unique architecture moved away from the old-fashioned corridor hospitals built in the early part of the century. Instead Brunfaut used bold linear elements mixed with light airy interior spaces. It was built in a modernism and neues bauen style. On the roof used to be \u2018Prevoyance Sociale\u2019 written in bright red neon. We found one \u2018R\u2019 in a dark cellar under the hospital.\n\nDuring the Second World War the Red Cross reconverted it for several years into a hospital for 235 people. Later, from 1968 on, the function as a lung sanatorium was discontinued and the building was given a new purpose. Lemaire was now as a rehabilitation center for long-term sick and counseling for people with a disability.\n\u2018Institut Joseph Lemaire\u2019 was abandoned in 1987, since then squatters, graffiti artists and, of course, urban explorers took over the building. As a result most of the building is in very bad shape. Thieves and local youth trashed the place. For example metal parts were all stolen and there isn\u2019t one wall without some graffiti. But still the building is magnificent and beautiful. Due to its imaginative design, the sanatorium has been studied throughout the world and has been featured in many architectural publications.

This huge industrial site with many buildings housed some beautiful decay.\nOn August 24, 1900, architect Ren\u00e9 Buyck was given permission to built this cokes plant. The idea was to import British coal by ship, and to transform it into coke to supply the steel industry in the Ruhr and the Meuse valley. This explains the strategic position of the plant, right behind the floodgates, along the canal to Bruges and near the railroad. Together with the glassworks, the cokes plant was the only important industrial activity in the hundred years history of Zeebrugge Seaport.\nDuring its history, the plant has undergone many changes. In the 1930s there was even an ammunition- factory on the site. From the original installation, dating the beginning of the 20th century, there is only one huge coal bunker left. The majority of the buildings date from the 1920s. The coke-oven itself consists of a battery of 50 German furnaces made in 1930, 25 Otto-Simon-Carves furnaces from Holland dated 1952 and lastly 35 French CGCF furnaces from 1959. Only the French and the Dutch furnaces were active after the Second World War. Finding three different types of ovens on one site, makes Carcoke Zeebrugge interesting and unique. Other parts of the technical installation are mainly from the 1950s and 1960s.\nWhen the plant turned 100 years old, the Flemish government inherited the site from the former Cockerill-Sambre Company. OVAM, the Public Waste Agency of Flanders has received control of the site, with the purpose to clean it up and to convert it into new industrial area. Although many techniques do exist to conciliate conservation of the unique buildings with the cleaning up of the soil, conservation of any trace of the history and heritage is not taken into consideration. Eventually OVAM demolished all the buildings and destroyed all its fixtures and fittings. After 2005 there was nothing left.

The construction of a large dock and container terminal capable of receiving deep-sea ships is already underway on a site immediately next to the village. They want to build a second one, on the village grounds. These plans were made during a period the economy was rising.\nThe history of Doel goes back to the early 13th century. After many floods the village started growing. The Belgian village of Doel was reclaimed from the river Schelde at the beginning of the 17th century. During the year 1876 Doel has its most inhabitants, it housed 2511 people. Only 418 people are left in 2004, but in 2005 approximately 200 squatters moved in. Some punk squatters looking for fun, but also secretaries and shop assistants in search of free accommodation having been priced out of the housing market of the city.\nFour years later, in 2008, the village has really turned into a ghost town. The atmosphere in the village is strange: some asylum seekers wander aimlessly around the seemingly deserted streets. Thieves regularly strip vacated houses of anything of any value. Weekend disaster tourists descend on the village. I talked to last people living there, the old police officer from Doel takes us to the most beautiful building of the village, het Hooghuis, it used to be the second home of the painter Rubens.\nIn 2010 the school, restaurants and hotels are all closed. The tiny post office and police station are rarely open. Only one shop is left \u2013 an electrical appliance store \u2013 and the two caf\u00e9s remain. But a mixed band of residents, both locals and newcomers, are beginning a fight-back. In 2014, not much time after the last few people left the village, the government changed the development plan back to living area.
